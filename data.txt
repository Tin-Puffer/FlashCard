A developer created a Lightning web component that uses a lightning-record-edit-form to collect information about Leads. Users complain that they only see one error message at a time about their input when trying to save a Lead record.
What is the recommended approach to perform validations on more than one field, and display multiple error messages simultaneously with minimal JavaScript intervention?
A. Try/catch/finally block
B. External JavaScript library
C. Validation rules
D. Apex trigger
**
C. Validation rules .✅
**
Explanation:
Salesforce validation rules are declarative and can be used to validate more than one field on an object and display multiple error messages. This approach requires minimal JavaScript code and uses Salesforce's built- in validation framework. References:
* Validation Rules

Consider the queries in the options below and the following Information:
* For these queries, assume that there are more than 200,000 Account records.
* These records Include soft-deleted records; that is, deleted records that are still in the Recycle Bin.
* There are two fields that are marked as External Id on the
Account. These fields are customer_Number_c and ERR_Key_ s.
Which two queries are optimized for large data volumes?
Choose 2 answers
A. SELECT Id FROM Account WHERE Name != NULL
B. SELECT 1d FROM Accounts WHERE Name != '' AND Customer_Number_c = 'ValueA'
C. SELECT ID FROM Account WHRE id IN :aListVariable
D. SELECT Id FROM Account WHERE Name != ''AND IsDeleted = false
**
B. SELECT 1d FROM Accounts WHERE Name != ''AND Customer_Number_c = 'ValueA' ✅
C. SELECT ID FROM Account WHRE id IN :aListVariable ✅
**
Explanation:
For optimizing queries, especially on large data volumes, it's recommended to use indexed fields such as External ID fields, which will make the queries selective. Among the options given:
* B) is optimized because it is using the Customer_Number__c field, which is an External ID and hence indexed.
* D) is also optimized because it filters out deleted records with IsDeleted = false and uses Name != ' ', which is likely to be selective.
Using indexed fields and filtering out unnecessary records helps in faster query execution on large data volumes.

Which technique can run custom logic when a Lightning web component is loaded?
A. Use an <aura:handler> init event to call a function.
B. Use the randersd loack { } method.
C. Call 52. engqueusiction and pass in the method to call.
D. Use the connectedCallback { } method.
**
D. Use the connectedCallback { } method. ✅ 
**
Explanation:
The connectedCallback() lifecycle hook in Lightning Web Components (LWC) is used to perform logic after a component is inserted into the DOM, making it the ideal place to execute custom logic when the component is loaded.

A developer created the following test method:
@isTest(SeeAllData = true)
public static void testDeleteTrigger() {
    Account testAccount = new Account(name = 'Test1');
    insert testAccount;

    List<Account> testAccounts = [SELECT Id, Name FROM Account WHERE Name LIKE 'Test%'];
    System.assert(testAccounts.size() != 0);

    delete testAccounts;
    testAccounts = [SELECT Id, Name FROM Account WHERE Name LIKE 'Test%'];
    System.assert(testAccounts.size() == 0);
}


The developer org has five accounts where the name starts with "Test". The developer executes this test in the Developer Console.
After the test code runs, which statement is true?
A. The test will fail.
B. There will be no accounts where the name starts with "Test".
C. There will be five accounts where the name starts with "Test".
D. There will be six accounts where the name starts with "Test".
**
C. There will be five accounts where the name starts with "Test".  ✅ 
**
Explanation:
Since the SeeAllData=true annotation is used, the test class does not have its own test data and is relying on the data in the org. The org already has accounts with the name starting with "Test", so the assertion that no accounts should exist after the deletion will fail because the test method only deletes the account that was created within its scope.

</lightning:layout>
**
Explanation:
To meet the requirements specified for displaying information differently on mobile devices versus desktops and tablets, the developer needs to use Lightning Layout and Lightning Layout Item components with appropriate size attributes to control the layout based on the form factor.
* Option A is correct because it sets the size attribute to "12" for desktop and tablet devices, which tells the framework to take the full width of the container, resulting in a single row. For mobile devices, it defaults to full width, which will stack the layout items vertically, resulting in three rows.
* Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they either do not set the correct size attributes for desktops and tablets or do not maintain the proper structure that would result in a single row for these devices.

A Salesforce org has more than 50,000 contacts. A new business process requires a calculation that aggregates data from all of these contact records. This calculation needs to run once a day after business hours.
which two steps should a developer take to accomplish this?
Choose 2 answers
A. Implement the Queueable interface.

B. Use the future annotation.

C. Implement the Schedulable interface.

D. Implement the Database.Batchable interface.
**
C. Implement the Schedulable interface. ✅
D. Implement the Database.Batchable interface. ✅
**
Explanation:
When dealing with large datasets and the need to perform complex calculations or data aggregation, batch Apex and scheduling are typically used to efficiently process records in batches and to execute the process during off-peak hours.
* Option B is correct because using the @future annotation allows you to run methods in the background, but it is not suitable for operations that need to process more than 50,000 records, which is the governor limit for future methods.
* Option C is correct because implementing the Schedulable interface allows you to schedule the class to run at specified times, such as after business hours, which is a requirement for this scenario.
* Option A is incorrect because Queueable is typically used for chaining jobs and handling asynchronous processing of individual transactions, not for processing large datasets at scheduled times.
* Option D is incorrect because the Database.Batchable interface is what's needed for processing large datasets, not Database.Stateful. The Database.Stateful interface is used to maintain state across batch job transactions.

Universal Containers wants to notify an external system in the event that an unhandled exception occurs when their nightly Apex batch job runs.
What is the appropriate publish/subscribe logic to meet this requirement?
A. Have the external system subscribe to a custom Platform Event that gets fired with addError{).
B. Have the external system subscribe to a customPlatform Event that gets fired with EventBus.publish(1,
C. Have the external system subscribe to a standardPlatform Event that gets fired with with Eventbus.publish(1.
D. Have the external system subscribe to a standard Platform Event that gets fired.
**
B. Have the external system subscribe to a customPlatform Event that gets fired with EventBus.publish(1, ✅
**
Explanation:
To notify an external system about an unhandled exception in a batch job, the appropriate approach is to have the external system subscribe to a custom Platform Event that gets published using EventBus.publish(). When an exception occurs, the batch job can publish this event which the external system can listen for and respond to accordingly. References:
* Platform Events Developer Guide
??
After a platform event is defined in a Salesforce org,events can be published via which mechanism?
A. External Apps use an API Co publish event messages.
B. Internal Apps can use entitlement processes.
C. External Apps require the standard Streaming API.
D. Internal Apps can use outbound messages.
**
A. External Apps use an API Co publish event messages. ✅ 
**
Explanation:
Platform events in Salesforce can be published using a variety of mechanisms, including from external applications through the Salesforce APIs.
Option A is correct because external applications can use Salesforce APIs such as the REST API or the SOAP API to publish events to a platform event in Salesforce.
Options B, C, and D describe mechanisms that are not used for publishing platform events. Entitlement processes are for setting up and tracking service contracts, the standard Streaming API is for subscribing to events not publishing them, and outbound messages are a workflow action used to send information to external services, not for publishing platform events.

A Salesforce developer is hired by a multi-national company to build a custom Lightning application that shows employees their employment benefits and earned commissions over time. The application must acknowledge and respect the user's locale context for dates, times, numbers, currency, and currency symbols.
When using Aura components, which approach should the developer implement to ensure the Lightning application complies with the user's locale?
A. Use the $User global variable to retrieve the user preferences.
B. Use the $Label global value provider.
C. Use the $Lacale value provider to retrieve the user preferences.
D. Create a Hierarchical custom setting to store user preferences.
**
C. Use the $Lacale value provider to retrieve the user preferences. ✅ 
**
Explanation:
The $Locale value provider should be used to ensure the Lightning application respects the user's locale for dates, times, numbers, currency, and currency symbols. This global value provider gives components access to locale formats and labels, which are automatically rendered according to the user's locale settings.

A developer is debugging an Apex-based order creation process that has a requirement to have three savepoints, SP1, SP2, and 5P3 {created in order), before the final execution of the process.
During the final execution process, the developer has a routine to roll back to SP1 for a given condition. Once the condition is fixed, the code then calls 2 roll back to SP3 to continue with final execution. However, when the roll back to SP3 is called, a Funtime error occurs.
Why does the developer receive a runtime error?
A. SP3 became invalid when SP1 was rolled back.
B. The developer has too many DML statements between the savepoints.
C. The developer used too many savepoints in one trigger session.
D. The developer should have called SF2 before calling SP3.
**
A. SP3 became invalid when SP1 was rolled back. ✅ 
**
Explanation:
Savepoints in Apex are markers within a transaction and rolling back to an earlier savepoint (SP1) invalidates any savepoints created after it. Thus, SP3 is invalidated when the code rolls back to SP1, causing a runtime error when a rollback to SP3 is attempted.

Assuming the CreateOneAccount class creates one account and implements the Queueable interface, which syntax properly tests the Apex code?
A. 
List<Account> accts;
System.enqueueJob(new CreateOneAccount());
Test.startTest();
System.assertEquals(1, accts.size());
Test.stopTest();
B.
List<Account> accts;
Test.startTest();
System.enqueueJob(new CreateOneAccount());
Test.stopTest();
accts = [SELECT Id FROM Account];
System.assertEquals(1, accts.size());
C.
List<Account> accts;
System.enqueueJob(new CreateOneAccount());
Test.getFlexQueueOrder();
System.assertEquals(1, accts.size());
D.
List<Account> accts;
System.enqueueJob(new CreateOneAccount());
accts = [SELECT Id FROM Account];
System.assertEquals(1, accts.size());
**
B. ✅ 
List<Account> accts;
Test.startTest();
System.enqueueJob(new CreateOneAccount());
Test.stopTest();
accts = [SELECT Id FROM Account];
System.assertEquals(1, accts.size());
**
Explanation:
To test Queueable Apex, Test.startTest() and Test.stopTest() should be used to ensure the asynchronous code is executed before assertions are made. After calling Test.stopTest(), you would then query for the records to assert that the queueable job correctly created the Account records.

When developing a Lightning web component, which setting displays lightninglayout-items im one column on small devices, such as mobile phones, and in two columns on tablet-size and desktop-size screens?
A. Set size="12" tablet-device-size="6"
B. Set size="12" medium-device-size="6"
C. Set size="6" mobile-device-size="12"
D. Set size="6" small-device-size="12"
**
B. Set size="12" medium-device-size="6" ✅ 
**
Explanation:
To display lightning-layout-items in one column on small devices and in two columns on larger devices, you should set the size attribute to "12" for small devices and the medium-device-size attribute to "6". This ensures that on small devices each item takes the full width, and on medium or larger devices, items take up half the width.

A Visualforce page contains an industry select list and displays a table of Accounts that have a matching value in their Industry field.
<apex:selectList value="{!selectedIndustry}">
    <apex:selectOptions value="{!industries}"/>
</apex:selectList>
When a user changes the value in the industry select list, the table of Accounts should be automatically updated to show the Accounts associated with the selected industry, What is the optimal way to implement this?
A. Add an <apex:actionsupport> within the <apex:selectOptions>.
B. Add an <apex:actionFunction> within the <apax:selecList>.
C. Add an <apex:actionsupport> within the <apex:selecList>.
D. Add an <apex:actionFunction> within the <apex:selectOptions>.
**
C. Add an <apex:actionsupport> within the <apex:selecList>. ✅ 
**
Explanation:
The <apex:actionSupport> component is designed to be used with another component to provide AJAX support. When the value of the industry select list changes, the <apex:actionSupport> can trigger an AJAX request to the server, causing the page to rerender the table of Accounts with the matching industry. This process occurs without a full page refresh, providing a smoother user experience.

A company needs to automatically delete sensitive information after seven years.
This could delete almost a million records every day.
How can this be achieved?
A. Schedule an @fuzure process to query records older than seven years, and then recursively invoke itself in 1,000 record batches to delete them,
B. Use aggregate functions to query for records older than seven years, and then delete the aggrigateResults objects.
C. Schedule a batch Apex process to run every day that queries and deletes records older than seven years.
D. Perform a SOSL statement to find records older than 7 years, and then delete the entire result set.
**
D. Schedule a batch Apex process to run every day that queries and deletes records older than seven years.✅ 
**
Explanation:
Batch Apex is designed to handle large data operations by breaking the transaction into smaller batches.
Scheduling a batch process to run daily enables the system to manage the deletion of large numbers of records efficiently, without hitting governor limits. It's the best practice for performing mass deletions on a regular schedule.

A company's support process dictates that any time a case is closed with a status of "Could net fix," an Engineering Review custom object record should be created and populated with information from the case, the contact, and any of the products associated with the case.
What Is the correct way to automate this using an Apex trigger?
A. An after update trigger on Case that creates the Engineering Review record and inserts it
B. An after upset trigger on Case that creates the Engineering Review record and inserts It .
C. A before update trigger on Case that creates the Engineering Review record and Inserts It
D. A before upset trigger on Case that creates the Engineering Review record and Inserts it
**
A. An after update trigger on Case that creates the Engineering Review record and inserts it ✅
**
Explanation:
In Salesforce, triggers can be defined to execute before or after a DML operation. An "after" trigger is used when you want to use the records that have been changed and rely on their committed values. In this scenario, you would use an after update trigger because you need to create a new record (Engineering Review) after the case has been updated with a status of "Could not fix". This cannot be done in a "before" trigger because the changes have not yet been committed to the database.
Therefore, the correct answer is A, which specifies an after update trigger on the Case object to create and insert the Engineering Review record.

What is the optimal technique for 2 developer to troubleshoot this?
A. Disable all flows, and then re-enable them one at at time to see which one causes the error.
B. Run the Apex Test Classes for the Apex trigger to ensure the code still has sufficient code coverage.
C. Set up debug logging for every Sales Rep, then monitor the logs for errors and exceptions,
D. Add system.debug() statements to the code and use the Developer Console logs to trace the code.
**
D. Add system.debug() statements to the code and use the Developer Console logs to trace the code. ✅
**
Explanation:
To troubleshoot the issue of a trigger creating two order records, adding System.debug() statements in the trigger and analyzing the log output in the Developer Console is an effective technique. This will help identify if the trigger is being called more than once or if there is another automation (such as a flow or workflow) causing the additional record creation.

As part of point-to-point integration, a developer must call an external web service which, due to high demand, takes a long time to provide a response. As part of the request, the developer must collect key Inputs from the end user before making the callout. Which two elements should the developer use to Implement these business requirements?
Choose 2 answers
A. Lightning web component
B. Apex method that returns a Continuation object
C. Screen Flow
D. Process Builder
**
A. Lightning web component ✅
B. Apex method that returns a Continuation object ✅
**
Explanation:
For implementing business requirements that involve collecting key inputs from the end user before making a long-running callout, a combination of a Lightning web component and an Apex method that returns a Continuation object is ideal. The Lightning web component can be used to build a user-friendly interface to collect the inputs, and the Continuation object in Apex allows for managing the callout in an asynchronous way. This pattern prevents the user interface from freezing and provides a better user experience by allowing the callout to run in the background.

C. Upload a third-party data table library as a static resource.
D. Use the standard Account List controller and implement pagination.
**
D. Use the standard Account List controller and implement pagination. ✅

An Apex trigger creates a Contract record every time an Opportunity record is marked as Closed and Won. This trigger is working great, except (due to a recent acquisition) historical Opportunity records need to be loaded into the Salesforce instance.
When a test batch of records are loaded, the Apex trigger creates Contract records.
A developer is tasked with preventing Contract records from being created when mass loading the Opportunities, but the daily users still need to have the Contract records created.
'What is the most extendable way to update the Apex trigger to accomplish this?
A. Add the Profile ID of the user who loads the data to the trigger, so the trigger will not fire for this user.
B. Add a validation rule to the Contract to prevent Contract creation by the user who loads the data.
C. Use a hierarchy custom setting to skip executing the logic inside the trigger for the user who loads the data.
D. Use a list custom setting ta disable the trigger for the user who loads the data.
**
C. Use a hierarchy custom setting to skip executing the logic inside the trigger for the user who loads the data. ✅

Universal Containers develops a Salesforce application that requires frequent interaction with an external REST API.
To avoid duplicating code and improve maintainability, how should they implement the APL integration for code reuse?
A. Use a separate Apex class for each API endpoint to encapsulate the integration logic,
B. Include the API integration code directly in each Apex class that requires it.
C. Create a reusable Apex class for the AFL integration and invoke it from the relevant Apex classes.
D. Store the APT integration code as a static resource and reference it in each Apex class.
**
C. Create a reusable Apex class for the AFL integration and invoke it from the relevant Apex classes. ✅
**
Explanation:
Creating a reusable Apex class for API integration allows for code encapsulation and maintainability. This class can then be invoked from any other Apex class that requires interaction with the API, preventing code duplication.

A developer built an Aura component for guests to self-register upon arrival at a front desk kiosk. Now the developer needs to create a component for the utility tray to alert users whenever a guest arrives at the front desk.
What should be used?
A. DML Operation
B. Changelog
C. Application Event
D. Component Event
**
C. Application Event ✅
**
Explanation:
Application Events in Aura components are used for communication between components that are not in the same containment hierarchy. An application event to alert users about the arrival of a guest at the front desk is appropriate because it allows any component within the app to listen and respond to the event, regardless of where it is located in the component hierarchy.

Which statement is true regarding savepoints?
A. You can roll back to any savepoint variable created in any order.
B. Static variables are not reverted during a rollback.
C. Reference to savepoints can cross trigger invocations.
D. Savepoints are not limited by DML statement governor limits.
**
B. Static variables are not reverted during a rollback. ✅
**
Explanation:
When rolling back to a savepoint, any DML operations that occurred after that savepoint are undone, but static variables are not reverted. Therefore, when a rollback occurs, the state of all static variables at the time of the rollback remains the same as it was just before the rollback.

A developer used custom settings to store some configuration data that changes occasionally. However, tests are now Failing in some of the sandboxes that were recently refreshed.
What should be done to eliminate this issue going forward?
A. Set the setting type on the custom setting to List.
B. Replace custom settings with static resources.
C. Set the setting type on the custom setting to Hierarchy.
D. Replace custom settings with custom metadata.
**
D. Replace custom settings with custom metadata.✅
**
Explanation:
Replacing custom settings with custom metadata types is a good solution to ensure that test data is consistent across environments. Custom metadata types are deployable, and their records are available in test methods by default, unlike List Custom Settings which need to be manually recreated in each environment after a refresh.

Universal Charities (UC) uses Salesforce to collect electronic donations in the form of credit card deductions from individuals and corporations.
When a customer service agent enters the credit card information, it must be sent to 8 3rd-party payment processor for the donation to be processed, UC uses one payment processor for individuals and a different one for corporations.
What should a developer use to store the payment processor settings for the different payment processors, so that their system administrator can modify the settings once they are deployed, if needed?
A. Custom object
B. Custom metadata
C. Hierarchy custom setting
D. List custom setting
**
B. Custom metadata ✅
**
Explanation:
Custom metadata types are ideal for storing payment processor settings that need to be changed by an administrator post-deployment. They can be deployed with managed packages and are upgradeable. Unlike Custom Objects, Custom Metadata Types also support a deployment with active data and can have their records retrieved via SOQL in Apex.

A company uses Dpportunities to track sales to their customers and their org has millions of Opportunities.
They want to begin to track revenue over time through a related Revenue object.
As part of their initial implementation, they want to perform a one-time seeding of their data by automatically creating and populating Revenue records for Opportunities, based on complex logic.
They estimate that roughly 100,000 Opportunities will have Revenue records created and populated.
What is the optimal way to automate this?
A. Use system, acheduladeb() to schedule a patakape.Scheduleable class.
B. Use system, enqueuJob (| to invoke a gueusable class.
C. Use Database. executeBatch () to invoke a Queueable class.
D. Use Database. =executeBatch() to invoke a Database. Batchable class.
**
D. Use Database. =executeBatch() to invoke a Database. Batchable class.✅
**
Explanation:
For a one-time bulk operation on a large data set, using a Database.Batchable class is the best approach. This allows complex logic to be processed in manageable chunks and efficiently manages system resources.

A developer has working business logic code, but sees the following error in the test class:
You have uncommitted work pending. Please commit or rollback before calling out.
What is a possible solution?
A. Call support for help with the target endpoint, as It is likely an external code error.
B. Use test.IsRunningTest() before making the callout to bypass it in test execution.
C. Set seeAllData to true the top of the test class, since the code does not fall in practice.
D. Rewrite the business logic and test classes with @Testvisible set on the callout.
**
B. Use test.IsRunningTest() before making the callout to bypass it in test execution. ✅
**
Explanation:
The error "You have uncommitted work pending. Please commit or rollback before calling out" usually indicates that DML operations (like insert, update, delete) are being performed before a callout in a test context. This is not allowed because Salesforce does not support this sequence of operations in a single transaction. However, the use of seeAllData=true is generally not a recommended practice and does not address the core issue of mixed DML and callouts in tests. The correct solution is to use a mocking framework to simulate the callout response. By using Test.setMock(), developers can avoid performing actual callouts in test methods, thus bypassing the uncommitted work error.

Universal Containers decided to use Salesforce to manage a new hire interview process. A custom object called Candidate was created with organization-wide defaults set to Private. A lookup on the Candidate object sets an employee as an Interviewer.
What should be used to automatically give Read access to the record when the lookup field is set to the Interviewer user?
A. The record can be shared using an Apex class.
B. The record can be shared using a permission set.
C. The record can be shared using a sharing rule.
D. The record cannot he shared with the current setup.
**
A. The record can be shared using an Apex class. ✅
**
Explanation:
A sharing rule can be used to automatically give Read access to a user specified in a lookup field. Sharing rules are declarative and can be based on criteria such as the value of a lookup field. This can be done without writing code and is maintainable through the Salesforce UI.

Refer to the following code snippet:
public class LeadController {
    public static List<Lead> getFetchLeadList(String searchTerm, Decimal aRevenue) {
        String safeTerm = '%' + searchTerm.escapeSingleQuotes() + '%';
        return [
            SELECT Name, Company, AnnualRevenue
            FROM Lead
            WHERE AnnualRevenue >= :aRevenue
            AND Company LIKE :safeTerm

        ];
    }
}

A developer created a JavaScript function as part of a Lightning web component (LWC) that surfaces information about Leads by wire calling geyFetchLeadList whencertain criteria are met.
Which three changes should the developer implement in the Apex class above to ensure the LWC can display data efficiently while preserving security?
Choose 3 answers
A. Annotate the Apex method with @AuraEnabled.
B. Implement the with sharing keyword in the class declaration.
C. Implement the with keyword in the class declaration.
D. Use the WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED clause within the SOQL query.
E. Annotate the Apex method with @AuraEnabled(Cacheable=True).
**
B. Implement the with sharing keyword in the class declaration.✅
E. Annotate the Apex method with @AuraEnabled(Cacheable=True).✅
D. Use the WITH SECURITY_ENFORCED clause within the SOQL query.✅
**
Explanation:
The Apex class needs to have the method annotated with @AuraEnabled to expose it to the LWC. The 'with sharing' keyword ensures that the data access is enforced according to the user's permissions. @AuraEnabled (cacheable=true) allows client-side caching for improved performance.

Refer to the test method below:
@isTest
static void testIncrement() {
    Account acct = new Account(Name = 'Test');
    acct.Number_Of_Times_Viewed__c = 0;
    insert acct;

    AuditUtil.incrementViewed(acct.id);
    
    Account acctAfter = [SELECT Number_Of_Times_Viewed__c FROM Account WHERE Id = :acct.Id][0];
    
    System.assertEquals(1, acctAfter.Number_Of_Times_Viewed__c);
}

The test method calls an @future method that increments the
Number_of_Times_Viewed__c value. The assertion is failing because the
Number of Times Viewed_c equals 0.
What is the optimal way to fix this?
A. Change the assertion to system.asserciquals (0, acctAfter Number _Cf_Timea_Viewed__c).
B. Add Test.atartTeat() before and Teat.stopTest() after inser= acct.
C. Add rest.staztTest() before and Test.stopTess() after AuditUcil.incrementViewed.
D. Change the initialization to acct. Number_Of_Times_Viewed_c = 1.
**
C. Add rest.staztTest() before and Test.stopTess() after AuditUcil.incrementViewed. ✅
**
Explanation:
When a test method calls an @future method that performs DML operations, the changes made by the
@future method won't be visible until after the Test.stopTest() is called. This method ensures that all asynchronous processes are completed before the test execution continues. Therefore, Test.startTest() should be before the call to the @future method and Test.stopTest() immediately after.

A business currently has a process to manually upload orders from its external Order Management System (OMS) into Salesforce.
This is a labor intensive process since accounts must be exported out of Salesforce to get the IDs. The upload file must be updated with the correct account IDs to relate the orders to the corresponding accounts.
Which two recommendations should make this process more efficient?
Choose 2 answers
A. Identify unique fields on Order and Account and set them as External IDs.
B. Use the insert wizard in the Data Loader to import the data.
C. Ensure the data in the file is sorted by the order ID.
D. Use the upsert wizard in the Data Loader to import the data.
**
A. Identify unique fields on Order and Account and set them as External IDs. ✅
D. Use the upsert wizard in the Data Loader to import the data. ✅
**
Explanation:
Setting unique fields on related objects as External IDs allows for the creation of relationships during imports without needing Salesforce IDs. The upsert operation in Data Loader can then use these External IDs to relate records, which streamlines the process and avoids the need to export Salesforce IDs manually.

A developer is building a complex commission calculation engine in Apex that is called from an Opportunity trigger. During QA it was reported that the calculations are incorrect.
The developer has representative test data and passing test methods in their developer sandbox.
Which three tools or techniques could the developer use to execute the code and pause it at key lines to visually inspect values of various Apex variables?
Choose 3 answers
A. Apex Interactive Debugger
B. Workbench
C. Developer Console
D. Breakpoints
E. Apex Replay Debugger
**
A. Apex Interactive Debugger ✅
C. Developer Console ✅
E. Apex Replay Debugger ✅
**
Explanation:
To debug and troubleshoot the commission calculation engine, a developer can use several tools provided by Salesforce to inspect and pause the execution of Apex code.
* Apex Interactive Debugger: It allows real-time debugging of Apex code execution. With this tool, a developer can set breakpoints, step through code, inspect variables, and evaluate expressions.
* Developer Console: Although the Developer Console does not allow interactive debugging, it does provide the ability to view logs that capture the execution of code. Debug logs can be inspected to understand the flow of execution and values of variables at different points in time.
* Apex Replay Debugger: This tool is part of Salesforce Extensions for Visual Studio Code. It allows a developer to replay a debug log as if they are stepping through the code line by line, which can be very useful to inspect the state of variables at specific points in the execution.

Consider the Apex class below that defines a RemoteAction used on 2 Visualforce search page.
global with sharing class MyRemoter {
    public String accountName { get; set; }

    public static Account account { get; set; }

    public MyRemoter() {}

                   FROM Account WHERE Name = :accountName];

        return account;
    }
}

Which code snippet will assert that the remote action returned the correct Account?

A. Account a = controller.getAccount('TestAccount');
System.assertEquals('TestAccount', a.Name);

B. MyRemoter remote = new MyRemoter('TestAccount');
Account a = remote.getAccount();
System.assertEquals('TestAccount', a.Name);

C. Account a = MyRemoter.getAccount('TestAccount');
System.assertEquals('TestAccount', a.Name);

D. MyRemoter remote = new MyRemoter();
Account a = remote.getAccount('TestAccount');
System.assertEquals('TestAccount', a.Name);
**
C. Account a = MyRemoter.getAccount('TestAccount');  ✅
System.assertEquals('TestAccount', a.Name);
**
Explanation:
The correct code snippet to assert that the remote action returned the correct Account is option C. This is because the getAccount method is a global static method within the MyRemoter class and can be directly called without needing to instantiate an object of the class.

A company has a custom object, Order__c, that has a custom picklist field, Status__c, with values of `"New',
`"In Progress', or `"Fulfilled' and a lookup field,
Contact__c, to Contact.
Which SOQL query will return a unique list of all the Contact records that have no `"Fulfilled' Orders?
A. SELECT Id FROM Contact WHERE Id NOT IN (SELECT Id FROM Order__c WHERE Status__c =
'Fulfilled')
B. SELECT Contact__c FROM Order__c WHERE Status__c <> 'Fulfilled'
C. SELECT Id FROM Contact WHERE Id NOT IN (SELECT Contact__c FROM Order__c WHERE Status__c = 'Fulfilled')
D. SELECT Contact__c FROM Order__c WHERE Id NOT IN (SELECT Id FROM Order__c Where Status__c = 'Fulfilled')
**
C. SELECT Id FROM Contact WHERE Id NOT IN (SELECT Contact__c FROM Order__c WHERE Status__c = 'Fulfilled') ✅
**
Explanation:
The correct SOQL query to return a unique list of Contact records that have no 'Fulfilled' Orders is one that selects Ids from the Contact object where the Contact Id is not in the set of Contact Ids related to 'Fulfilled' Orders. This is done by a subquery that selects the Contact__c field from the Order__c records where the Status__c is 'Fulfilled'.

A developer has a test class that creates test data before making a mock callout but now receives a 'You have uncommitted work pending. Please commit or rollback before calling out' error.
Which step should be taken to resolve the error?
A. Ensure both the Insertion and mock callout occur after the I==L. stoptest_().
B. Ensure the records are Inserted before the Tezt.startTest() statement and the mock callout occurs within a method annotated with @testSetup.
C. Ensure both the insertion and mock callout occur after the Test.startTest().
D. Ensure the records are inserted before the Test.startTess() statement and the mock callout occurs after the Test. Startest().
**
D. Ensure the records are inserted before the Test.startTess() statement and the mock callout occurs after the Test. Startest().✅
**
Explanation:
When working with Apex tests that involve callouts, it's important to avoid the 'uncommitted work pending' error. This error typically occurs because DML operations (like inserts) are pending when a callout is attempted. Salesforce requires that all callouts are made before any DML operations in a transaction. To avoid this, the pattern is to insert the records before calling Test.startTest(), and then make the callout after this call. Test.startTest() marks the point where your actual test begins, and it resets the governor limits. By making the callout after this point, it ensures that the DML operations are committed and you are within a new execution context regarding governor limits.

A developer created a Lightning web component that uses a Lightning_record_edit_fom to collect Information about Leads. Users complain that they only see one error message at a time about their input when trying to save a Lead record.
Which best practice should the developer use to perform the validations on more than one held, thus allowing more than one error message to be displayed simultaneously?
A. Apex REST
B. Client_side validation
C. Custom validation rules
D. Next Best Action
**
B. Client_side validation✅
**
Explanation:
When users need to see multiple error messages at a time related to their input on a form, client-side validation is the preferred method. This allows immediate feedback on the input fields without the need to submit the form to the server.
* Option B (Client-side validation) is correct because it enables validation of multiple fields before submitting the form, allowing users to see all error messages at once for the fields that fail validation.
* Options A (Apex REST), C (Custom validation rules), and D (Next Best Action) are not directly related to the validation of form inputs in the context of a Lightning web component.

A developer creates an application event that has triggered an infinite loop.
What may have caused this problem?
A. The event is fired from a custom renderer.
B. The event has multiple handlers registered in the project.
C. The event handler calls a trigger.
D. An event is fired 'ontouchend'' and is unhandled.
**
B. The event has multiple handlers registered in the project.  ✅
**
Explanation:
The infinite loop in the application event could be caused by multiple handlers registered in the project. If the event is fired and then handled in such a way that the handling leads to the event being fired again, this can create a loop. Care must be taken to ensure that the handling of the event does not re-trigger the same event unintentionally.

Users of this Visualforce page complain that the page does a full refresh every time the Search button Is pressed.
What should the developer do to ensure that a partial refresh Is made so that only the section identified with opportunity List is re-drawn on the screen?
A. Enclose the DATA table within the <apex:actionRegion> tag.
B. Implement the render attribute on the <apex:ccxmandButton> tag.
C. Ensure the action method search returns null.
D. Implement the <apex:actionfunction> tag with immediate = true.
**
B. Implement the render attribute on the <apex:ccxmandButton> tag.  ✅
**
Explanation:
To ensure that only a part of the Visualforce page is refreshed, developers can use the reRender attribute of the <apex:commandButton> tag. This attribute specifies the IDs of the components that should be re- rendered as a result of the action method being completed. In this case, setting the reRender attribute to the ID of the <apex:pageBlockSection> that contains the opportunity list will cause only that section to be updated on the page, resulting in a partial page refresh.
The correct answer is B because it uses the reRender attribute correctly to update only the specific part of the page (opportunityList) without a full page refresh.

A developer is asked to look into an issue where a scheduled Apex is running into DML limits. Upon investigation, the developer finds that the number of records processed by the scheduled Apex has recently increased to more than 10,000.
What should the developer do to eliminate the limit exception error?
A. Use the @future annotation.
B. Implement the Qususabls interface.
C. Implement the Batchable interface.
D. Use platform events.
**
C. Implement the Batchable interface. ✅
**
Explanation:
When scheduled Apex runs into DML limits due to a high number of records, implementing the Batchable interface is recommended. This allows the job to be broken down into smaller batches that are processed separately, thus avoiding hitting governor limits. References:

Given the following code:
for (Contact c : [SELECT Id, LastName FROM Contact WHERE CreatedDate = TODAY]) {
    Account a = [SELECT Id, Name FROM Account WHERE CreatedDate = TODAY LIMIT 5];
    c.AccountId = a.Id;
    update c;
}

Assuming there were 10 Contacts and five Accounts created today, what is the expected result?
A. System.QueryException: Too many DML Statement errors on Contact
B. System.QueryException: List has more than one row for Assignment on Account
C. Systemn.LimitException: Too many SOQL Queries on Account
D. System.LimitException: Too many SOQL Queries on Contact
**
B. System.QueryException: List has more than one row for Assignment on Account  ✅
**
Explanation:
The loop contains a SOQL query inside, causing it to run multiple times. This will throw a QueryException because the Account query returns more than one row.

A developer is building a Lightning web component that retrieves data from Salesforce and assigns it to the record property.

import { LightningElement, api, wire } from 'lwc';
import { getRecord } from 'lightning/uiRecordApi';

export default class Record extends LightningElement {
    @api fields;
    @api recordId;
    record;
}


What must be done in the component to get the data from Salesforce?

A.
Add the following code above record:
@wire(getRecord, { recordId: '$recordId', fields: '$fields' })

B.
Add the following code above record:
@api(getRecord, { recordId: '$recordId' })
Get the fields in a separate step and assign them to a record.

C.
Add the following code above record;
**
A. ✅
Add the following code above record:
@wire(getRecord, { recordId: '$recordId', fields: '$fields' })
**
Explanation:
Option A is the correct answer. The @wire decorator is used in conjunction with getRecord from lightning
/uiRecordApi to retrieve a record from Salesforce. The syntax @wire(getRecord, { recordId: '$recordId', fields: '$fields' }) sets up a reactive property, which means it will automatically rerun whenever the recordId or fields property changes.

The use of the transient keyword in Visualforce page controllers helps with which common performance issue?
A. Reduces load times
B. Improves page transfers
C. Reduces view state
D. Improves query performance
**
C. Reduces view state ✅
**
Explanation:
The transient keyword in Visualforce page controllers marks variables that should not be part of the view state, which can significantly reduce the size of the view state. This can help avoid view state limit errors and improve page performance because a smaller view state requires less time to send to the client.
References: Visualforce Developer Guide - Reducing View State Size

Universal Containers uses a custom Lightning page to provide a mechanism to perform a step-by-step wizard search for Accounts. One of the steps in the wizard is to allow the user to input text into a text field, ERF Number_c, that is then used in a query to find matching Accounts.

erpNumber = erpNumber + '%';
List<Account> accounts = [SELECT Id, Name FROM Account WHERE ERP_Number__c LIKE :erpNumber];

Which step should be taken to resolve the issue?
A. Perform the SOQL query as part of a for loop.
B. Mark the ERP_Numker = field as an external ID.
C. Mark the ERP_Number__ c field as required.
D. Move the SO0L query to within an asynchronous process.
**
D. Move the SO0L query to within an asynchronous process. ✅
**
Explanation:
If a SOQL query is causing performance issues due to a non-selective query on a large data volume, moving the query to an asynchronous process such as a Batch Apex or Queueable Apex can help resolve the issue.
This allows the query to run in the background without affecting the user's experience.

Salesforce users consistently receive a "Maximum trigger depth exceeded" error when saving an Account.
How can a developer fix this error?
A. Split the trigger logic into two separate triggers.
B. Convert the trigger to use the 3suzure annotation, and chain any subsequent trigger invocations to the Account object.
C. Modify the trigger to use the L=MultiThread=true annotation,
D. Use a helper class to set a Boolean to TRUE the first time a trigger 1s fired, and then modify the trigger ta only fire when the Boolean is FALSE.
**
D. Use a helper class to set a Boolean to TRUE the first time a trigger 1s fired, and then modify the trigger ta only fire when the Boolean is FALSE. ✅
**
Explanation:
A common solution to the "Maximum trigger depth exceeded" error is to use a static variable in a helper class. The variable acts as a switch to ensure the trigger logic only executes once per transaction, preventing recursive trigger calls.

A company uses Salesforce to sell products to customers. They also have an external product information management (PIM) system that is the system of record for products.
A developer received these requirements:
* Whenever a product is created or updated in the PIM, a product must be created or updated as a Product? record in Salesforce and a PricebookEntry record must be created or updated automatically by Salesforce.
= The PricebookEntry should be created in a Priceboek2 that is specified in a custom setting.
What should the developer use to satisfy these requirements?
A. Event Monitoring
B. Invocable Action
C. SObject Tree REST
D. Custom Apex REST
**
D. Custom Apex REST ✅
**
Explanation:
Custom Apex REST services are the optimal solution for integrating Salesforce with an external PIM system.
When a product is created or updated in the PIM, the external system can make a REST call to a custom Apex REST endpoint in Salesforce, which then can create or update the Product2 and PricebookEntry records. This method allows using custom settings to determine the Pricebook2 dynamically.

A developer is writing a Visualforce page that queries accounts in the system and presents a data table with the results. The users want to be able to filter the results based on up to five fields. However, the users want to pick the five fields to use as filter fields when they run the page.
Which Apex code feature is required to facilitate this solution?
A. Streaming API
B. Metadata APT
C. variable binding
D. dynamic SOQL
**
D. dynamic SOQL  ✅
**
Explanation:
The requirement described in the question calls for a flexible way to query records based on user-selected fields. Dynamic SOQL is the perfect tool for this job as it allows the construction of a SOQL string at runtime, which can include any number of fields and filter conditions that are determined at the time the user interacts with the page. This enables the creation of a highly customizable query interface. A, B, and C are not suitable for this requirement as they serve different purposes: A (Streaming API) is for receiving real-time streams of data changes, B (Metadata API) is for managing the metadata of your Salesforce org, and C (variable binding) is used in Visualforce to bind data between the page and the controller but does not provide dynamic query capabilities.

A Visualforce page needs to make a callout to get billing information and tax information from two different REST endpoints. The information needs to be displayed to the user at the same time and the return value of the billing information contains the input for the tax information callout. Each endpoint might take up to two minutes to process.
How should a developer implement the callouts?
A. An HTTP REST callout for the billing callout and a Continuation for the tax callout
B. A Continuation for both the billing callout and the tax callout
C. An HTTP REST callout for both the billing callout and the tax callout
D. A Continuation for the billing callout and an HTTP REST callout for the tax callout
**
B. A Continuation for both the billing callout and the tax callout ✅
**
Explanation:
Using Continuation for both callouts is the optimal solution when you have long-running callouts in a Visualforce page, as it allows the page to wait for a long-running process without tying up server resources.
The Continuation pattern is specifically designed for scenarios where the request-response cycle could exceed the timeout limits.

C. Lightning Component
D. Lightning Flow
**
D. Lightning Flow ✅ ( LWC cũng làm được hm...)

Just prior to a new deployment the Salesforce administrator, who configured a new order fulfillment process feature in a developer sandbox, suddenly left the company.
Ag part of the UAT cycle, the users had fully tested all of the changes in the sandbox and signed off on them; making the Order fulfillment feature ready for its go-live in the production environment.
Unfortunately, although a Change Set was started, it was not completed by the former administrator.
A developer is brought in to finish the deployment.
What should the developer do to identify the configuration changes that need to be moved into production?
A. In Salesforce setup, look at the last modified date for every object to determine which should be added to the Change Set.
B. Use the Metadata API and a supported development IDE to push all of the configuration from the sandbox into production to ensure no changes are lost.
C. Leverage the Setup Audit Trail to review the changes made by the departed Administrator and identify which changes should be added to the Change Set.
D. Set up Continuous Integration and a Git repository to automatically merge all changes from the sandbox metadata with the production metadata.
**
C. Leverage the Setup Audit Trail to review the changes made by the departed Administrator and identify which changes should be added to the Change Set. ✅

Which scenario requires a developer to use an Apex callout
Instead of Outbound Messaging?
A. The target system uses a REST APL.
B. The target system uses a SCAP API.
C. The callout needs to be asynchronous.
D. The callout needs to be invoked from a flow.
**
A. The target system uses a REST APL. ✅
**
Explanation:
Outbound Messaging in Salesforce provides a way to send notifications from Salesforce to external applications using SOAP-based web service calls. However, when the target system requires interactions with RESTful web services, a developer must use an Apex callout. This is because Outbound Messaging is limited to SOAP and cannot directly interact with REST APIs. Apex callouts provide the flexibility to make HTTP requests to REST endpoints, thus allowing developers to programmatically interact with virtually any web service provided by external systems.

A developer is working with existing functionality that tracks how many times a stage has changed for an Opportunity. When the Opportunity's stage is changed, a workflow rule is fired to increase the value of a field by one. The developer wrote an after trigger to create a child record when the field changes from 4 to 5.
A user changes the stage of an Opportunity and manually sets the count field to 4. The count field updates to
5, but the child record is not created.
What is the reason this is happening?
A. Trigger.old does not contain the updated value of the count field.
B. After triggers fire before workflow rules.
C. Trigger.new does not change after a field update.
D. After triggers are not fired after field updates.

A developer created an Apex class that updates an Account based on input from a Lightning web component that Is used to register an Account. The update to the Account should only be made if it has not already been registered.

account = [SELECT Id, Is_Registered__c FROM Account WHERE Id = :accountId];

if (!account.Is_Registered__c) {
    account.Is_Registered__c = true;
    // ...set other account fields
    update account;
}

What should the developer do to ensure that users do not overwrite each other's updates to the same Account if they make updates at the same time?
A. Add a try/catch block around the update.
B. Use upsert instead of update.
C.Use FOR UPDATE in the SOQL query.
D.Include LastModifiedDate in the query to make sure it wasn’t recently updated.
**
C.Use FOR UPDATE in the SOQL query. ✅
**
Explanation:
When multiple users are updating the same record at the same time, there is a risk of overwriting each other's changes. Salesforce provides a mechanism called 'record locking' to prevent this from happening.
* Option D is correct because including FOR UPDATE in the SOQL query locks the retrieved records for the duration of the transaction. This prevents other transactions from updating the record until the current transaction is complete, which is essential for avoiding race conditions where two users might overwrite each other's updates.
* Option A is incorrect because while adding a try/catch block around the update operation is good practice for handling exceptions, it does not prevent overwrites from concurrent updates.
* Option B is incorrect because using upsert instead of update does not address the problem of concurrent updates. The upsert operation is used to either insert a new record or update an existing one based on whether a record with a matching ID or external ID already exists.
* Option C is incorrect because FOR UPDATE should be used in the SOQL query to lock the records, not in the SELECT statement itself.

A developer is asked to modify a Lightning web component so that it displays in one column on phones and in two columns on tablets, desktops, and larger devices.
Given to the code below:

<lightning-layout multiple-rows="true">
    <lightning-layout-item>
        <div>Example 1</div>
    </lightning-layout-item>
    <lightning-layout-item>
        <div>Example 2</div>

Which should the developer add to the code to meet the requirements?

A.
Add small-device-size="12" to the <lightning-layout-item> elements

B.
Add size="6" small-device-size="12" to the <lightning-layout-item> elements

C.
Add size="12" medium-device-size="6" to the <lightning-layout-item> elements

D.
Add medium-device-size="6" to the <lightning-layout-item> elements
**
C.
Add size="12" medium-device-size="6" to the <lightning-layout-item> elements ✅
**
Explanation:
The requirement is for the Lightning web component to display in one column on phones and in two columns on larger devices. To achieve this, we should specify the size attributes for different devices using the design tokens provided by the Lightning Design System.
* Option B is correct because size="6" will set each lightning-layout-item to take up half the available space (since the grid system is based on a 12-column structure), creating two columns on tablets, desktops, and larger devices. small-device-size="12" will ensure that on small devices like phones, each item will take up the full width, resulting in a single column.
* Options A, C, and D do not meet the requirement correctly, as they either do not set the size correctly for small devices or do not specify the sizes for both small and larger devices appropriately.

An Apex class does not achieve expected code coverage. The testsetup method explicitly calls a method In the Apex class..
How can the developer generate the code coverage?
A. Use system.assert() in testSetup to verify the values are being returned.
B. Verify the user has permissions passing a user into System,.runds().
C. Call the Apex class method from a testsetup Instead of the testsetup methed.
D. Add @testvisible to the method in the class the developer is testing.
**
C. Call the Apex class method from a testsetup Instead of the testsetup methed.  ✅
**
Explanation:
When an Apex class does not achieve the expected code coverage, it suggests that the test methods are not executing parts of the class. The @testvisible annotation can be used to increase code coverage by allowing test methods to access private or protected members of another class. This enables the test method to call methods that may not be directly accessible, but it is not a direct means to generate code coverage. The code coverage is actually achieved when the test methods execute the code within these methods. Therefore, to properly generate code coverage, the developer must ensure that the test methods call the relevant portions of the code that need to be covered. The use of @testvisible can facilitate this process by making otherwise inaccessible code available for testing.

Which two components should a developer use to implement the creation of the Case from the Lightning web component?
Choose 2 answers
A. Lightning-record-edit-forth
B. lightning-input-fimld
C. Lightning-input
D. lightning-record-form
**
A. Lightning-record-edit-forth ✅
B. lightning-input-fimld ✅
**
Explanation:
To implement a Lightning web component that allows users to create a Case, you would need components that allow for input fields and the creation of records.
* Option C (Lightning-input) is correct because it allows developers to create custom form input elements that can be positioned in a non-linear fashion as required.
* Option D (lightning-record-form) is correct because it provides a simple way to create forms for viewing and editing Salesforce records and would be suitable for creating a new Case record.
* Option A (Lightning-record-edit-form) is not a valid component; it seems to be a misprint of lightning- record-edit-form, which is indeed a component used for creating and editing records but was not listed as an option.
* Option B (lightning-input-field) is used within the lightning-record-edit-form or lightning-record- view-form components to create editable or displayable fields respectively, but is not as versatile as lightning-input for custom layout purposes.

A developer implemented a custom data table in a Lightning web component with filter functionality.
However, users are submitting support tickets about long load times when the filters are changed. The component uses an Apex method that is called to query for records based on the selected filters.
What should the developer do to improve performance of the component?
A. Return all records into a list when the component is created and filter the array In JavaScript.
B. Use a selective SOQL query with a custom Index.
C. Use SOSL to query the records on filter change.
D. Use setstoraclel() in the Apex method to store the response In the client-side cache.
**
B. Use a selective SOQL query with a custom Index. ✅
**
Explanation:
When faced with performance issues in a Lightning Web Component (LWC) due to SOQL query load times, the optimal approach is often to improve the query's selectivity. This can be achieved by using a selective SOQL query with a custom index. Salesforce can create custom indexes to improve the performance of queries that cannot be optimized through standard indexing. When a query is selective, it can efficiently retrieve records from the database using the index, thus reducing the query execution time and speeding up the component's performance when filters are changed. The other options (returning all records, using SOSL, or client-side caching) do not directly address the root cause of the performance issue, which is the need for a more efficient database operation.

Which two best practices should the developer implement to optimize this code? Choose 2 answers
A. Change the trigger context to after update, after insert
B. Remove the DML statement.
C. Use a collection for the DML statement.
D. Query the Driving-Structure_C records outside of the loop
**
C. Use a collection for the DML statement. ✅
D. Query the Driving-Structure_C records outside of the loop ✅
**
Explanation:
To optimize the code in question, it's important to follow best practices that reduce the number of SOQL queries and DML statements within loops, as these can quickly consume governor limits and lead to inefficiencies. Option C is correct because using a collection to hold records and performing a single DML operation outside of loops reduces the number of DML operations, which is a best practice for bulkifying code in Salesforce. Option D is also correct because querying records outside of a loop prevents hitting SOQL governor limits and makes the code more efficient. Options A and B are not correct in the context provided, as there isn't enough information to determine if changing the trigger context is necessary, and removing the DML statement altogether may not be feasible if the logic requires data to be persisted.

A company has a custom component that allows users to search for records of a certain object type by invoking an Apex Controller that returns a list of results based on the user's input. When the search is completed, a searchComplete event is fired, with the results put in a results attribute of the event. The component is designed to be used within other components and may appear on a single page more than once.
What is the optimal code that should be added to fire the event when the search has completed?
A.
var evt = component.getEvent("searchComplete");
evt.setParams({ results: results });
evt.fire();
B. 
var evt = $A.get("e.c:searchComplete");
evt.set("v.results", results);
evt.fire();
C.
var evt = component.getEvent("searchComplete");
evt.set("v.results", results);
evt.fire();
D.
var evt = $A.get("e.c:searchComplete");
evt.setParams({ results: results });
evt.fire();
**
A ✅
var evt = component.getEvent("searchComplete");
evt.setParams({ results: results });
evt.fire();
**
Explanation:
The correct code to fire the event when the search has completed in a Lightning component is option B. $A.
get("e.c.searchComplete") is the syntax used to get the event, setParams is used to set the parameters, and fire is used to dispatch the event.

Given the following containment hierarchy:
What is the correct way to communicate the new value of a property named ''passthrough'' to my-parent- component if the property is defined within my-child-component?
A.
let cEvent = new CustomEvent('passthrough', { detail: this.passthrough });
this.dispatchEvent(cEvent);
B.
let cEvent = new CustomEvent('passthrough');
this.dispatchEvent(cEvent);
C.
let cEvent = new CustomEvent('passthrough': { detail: this.passthrough });
this.dispatchEvent(cEvent);
D.
let cEvent = new CustomEvent(passthrough);
this.dispatchEvent(cEvent);
**
A. ✅
let cEvent = new CustomEvent('passthrough', { detail: this.passthrough }); 
this.dispatchEvent(cEvent);
**
Explanation:
To communicate a property change up a containment hierarchy in Lightning Web Components (LWC), the child component should dispatch a custom event with the detail of the change. The parent component listens for this event and handles it accordingly.
Option A is the correct method because it creates a new custom event with the detail property containing the new value of passthrough. This event is then dispatched, and the parent component can listen for this event to handle the updated value.
Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they either don't pass any data with the event or they don't use the detail object which is the standard way to pass data with custom events in LWC.

A developer is asked to build a solution that will automatically send an email to the customer when an Opportunity stage changes. The solution must scale to allow for 10,000 emails per day. The criteria to send the email should be evaluated after certain conditions are met.
What is the optimal way to accomplish this?
A. Use an Email Alert with Flow Builder.
B. Use MassEmailMEssage () With an Apex trigger.
C. Use a Workflow Email Alert.
D. Use SingleEmailMessage() with an Apex trigger.
**
A. Use an Email Alert with Flow Builder. ✅
**
Explanation:
Using an Email Alert with Flow Builder allows for scalable solutions that can handle large volumes of emails, and it offloads the processing from Apex to Salesforce's declarative automation tools. This approach is also bulk-safe, as it does not rely on Apex code that could hit governor limits.

A Visuzlforce page loads slowly due to the large amount of data it displays.
Which strategy can a developer use to improve the performance?
A. Use lazy loading to load the data on demand, instead of in the controller's constructor.
B. Use an <apex:actionPollar) in the page to load all of the data asynchronously.
C. Use the transient keyword for the List variables used in the custom controller.
D. Use Javascript to move data processing to the browser instead of the controller.
**
A. Use lazy loading to load the data on demand, instead of in the controller's constructor.  ✅
**
Explanation:
Lazy loading is a strategy to improve the performance of a Visualforce page that loads a large amount of data.
By loading the data on demand, rather than in the controller's constructor, the initial page load is faster, and additional data is only loaded when necessary.

Given the following information regarding Universal Containers (UC):
* UC represents their customers as Accounts in Salesforce.
* All customers have a unique Customer__Number_c that is unique across all of UC's systems.
* UC also has a custom Invoice c object, with a Lookup to Account, to represent invoices that are sent out from their external system.
UC wants to integrate invoice data back into Salesforce so Sales Reps can see when a customer pays their bills on time.
What is the optimal way to implement this?
A. Ensure Customer Number cis an External ID and that a custom field Invoice Number cis an External ID and Upsert invoice data nightly.
B. Use Salesforce Connect and external data objects to seamlessly import the invoice data into Salesforce without custom code.
C. Create a cross-reference table in the custom invoicing system with the Salesforce Account ID of each Customer and insert invoice data nightly,
D. Query the Account Object upon each call to insert invoice data to fetch the Salesforce ID corresponding to the Customer Number on the invoice.
**
A. Ensure Customer Number cis an External ID and that a custom field Invoice Number cis an External ID and Upsert invoice data nightly. ✅
**
Explanation:
The optimal way to integrate invoice data into Salesforce, allowing for the upsert operation which can insert or update records based on the presence of the External ID, is to use the External ID fields. This ensures that the invoices are associated correctly with the existing Accounts and that upsert operations can be performed efficiently.

A developer needs to implement a historical Task reporting feature that allows users, assigned to a custom profile named "Auditors", to perform searches against the Tasks related to the Account object.
The developer must ensure the search is able to return Tasks that are between 12 and 24 months old. It should exclude any tasks which have been deleted, and include Tasks whether archived or not.
Given the following code, which select statement should be inserted at the placeholder as a valid way to retrieve the Tasks ranging from L2 to 24 months old?

Date initialDate = System.today().addMonths(-24);
Date endDate = System.today().addMonths(-12);
// Insert SELECT statement here
A
SELECT AccountId, CreatedDate, Subject
FROM Task
WHERE What.Type = 'Account' 
  AND IsDeleted = false 
  AND CreatedDate >= :initialDate 
  AND CreatedDate <= :endDate
ALL ROWS

B
SELECT AccountId, CreatedDate, Subject
FROM Task
WHERE What.Type = 'Account' 
  AND IsArchived = true 
  AND CreatedDate >= :initialDate 
  AND CreatedDate <= :endDate

C
SELECT AccountId, CreatedDate, Subject
FROM Task
WHERE What.Type = 'Account' 
  AND CreatedDate >= :initialDate 
  AND CreatedDate <= :endDate
ALL ROWS
**

A ✅
SELECT AccountId, CreatedDate, Subject
FROM Task
WHERE What.Type = 'Account' 
  AND IsDeleted = false 
  AND CreatedDate >= :initialDate 
  AND CreatedDate <= :endDate
ALL ROWS

**
Explanation:
To retrieve Tasks that are between 12 and 24 months old, we need to use a SOQL query that filters based on the CreatedDate. The query must exclude deleted records and include both active and archived tasks. Since Tasks can be archived after a certain period (typically 12 months), we must ensure the query includes these as well.
* Option C is correct because it uses ALL ROWS in the SOQL query, which includes both active and archived (soft-deleted) records. The query also correctly uses a range for CreatedDate to ensure it selects Tasks created between 12 to 24 months ago.
* Option A is incorrect because it does not include the ALL ROWS keyword, which is necessary to include archived Tasks in the results.
* Option B is incorrect because it only retrieves Tasks created in the last 12 months, not between 12 to 24 months ago.
* Option D is incorrect because it does not filter Tasks based on their creation date correctly to include only those that are between 12 and 24 months old.

Line 22:     //Utility to assert Number_Of_Transfers__c is correct based on test data
Line 23:     AssertUtil.assertNumberOfTransfers(acctsAfter);
Line 24: }


The test method tests an Apex trigger that the developer knows will make a lot of queries when a lot of Accounts are simultaneously updated to be customers.
The test method fails at the Line 20 because of too many SOQL queries.
What is the correct way to fix this?
A.
Use Limits.getLimitQueries() to find the total number of queries that can be issued.

B.
Change the DataFactory class to create fewer Accounts so that the number of queries in the trigger is reduced.

C.
Add Test.startTest() before and add Test.stopTest() after both Line 7 and Line 20 of the code.

D. 
Add Test.startTest() before and add Test.stopTest() after Line 18 of the code.
**
D. 
Add Test.startTest() before and add Test.stopTest() after Line 18 of the code. ✅
**
Explanation:
The correct way to fix this is to add Test.startTest() before and add Test.stopTest() after Line 18 of the code.
This will reset the governor limits for the code that executes between these two methods, and allow the test to run without hitting the SOQL query limit. The Test.startTest() and Test.stopTest() methods are used to test code that makes a lot of queries or calls asynchronous methods12. By using these methods, the developer can isolate the code that needs more resources and verify that it does not exceed the governor limits.

What are three reasons that a developer should write Jest tests for Lightning web components?
Choose 3 answers
A. To test a component's non-public properties.
B. To test basic user interaction
C. To verify the DOM output of a component
D. To test how multiple components work together
E. To verify that events fire when expected
**
B. To test basic user interaction ✅
C. To verify the DOM output of a component ✅
E. To verify that events fire when expected ✅
**
Explanation:
Jest tests are essential for developing Lightning Web Components (LWC) because they allow developers to ensure the quality and correctness of their components in isolation from the rest of the application. Reason A is incorrect because testing non-public properties breaks encapsulation and is considered bad practice. B is correct because Jest tests can simulate user interactions with the component, such as clicking buttons or entering text, to ensure it behaves as expected. C is correct as well because Jest tests can confirm that the component renders the expected DOM output, which is crucial for ensuring that the HTML structure of the component is accurate. D is not the best choice since Jest is more suited for testing components in isolation rather than how multiple components interact; integration tests are more appropriate for that. Lastly, E is correct because Jest tests can verify that events are fired at the appropriate times, which is a critical part of the component's interaction with the rest of the application.

An environment has two Apex triggers: an after-update trigger on Account and an after-update trigger on Contact.
The Account after-update trigger fires whenever an Account's address is updated, and it updates every associated Contact with that address. The Contact after-update trigger fires on every edit, and it updates every Campaign Member record related to the Contact with the Contact's state.
Consider the following: A mass update of 200 Account records' addresses, where each Account has 50 Contacts. Each Contact has one Campaign Member. This means there are 10,000 Contact records across the Accounts and 10,000 Campaign Member records across the contacts.
What will happen when the mass update occurs?
A. There will be no error and all updates will succeed, since the limit on the number of records processed by DML statements was not exceeded.
B. The mass update of Account address will succeed, but the Contact address updates will fail due to exceeding number of records processed by DML statements.
C. There will be no error, since each trigger fires within its own context and each trigger does not exceed the limit of the number of records processed by DML statements.
D. The mass update will fail, since the two triggers fire in the same context, thus exceeding the number of records processed by DML statements.
**
D. The mass update will fail, since the two triggers fire in the same context, thus exceeding the number of records processed by DML statements. ✅
**
Explanation:
In this scenario, the governor limit for DML statements (150 DML operations and 10,000 DML rows per transaction) will be exceeded because the updates will cascade across related objects, significantly multiplying the number of records processed.

A Lightning web component displays the Account name and two custom fields out of
275 that exist on the abject. The custom fields are correctly declared and populated. However, the developer receives complaints that the component performs slowly.
What can the developer do to improve the performance?
A. Replace Layout-type =''Full1" with Layout-type="Partial".
B. Replace layouts-type="Full" with fields={fields}.
C. Add density="compat" to the component.
D. Add cache="true" to the component.
**
B. Replace layouts-type="Full" with fields={fields}. ✅ 
**
Explanation:
To improve performance, the developer should specify only the fields needed by using the fields attribute in the lightning-record-form instead of loading all fields with layout-type="Full". This reduces the amount of data being retrieved and processed, thus improving the component's performance.

There is an Apex controller and a Visualforce page in an org that displays records with a custom filter consisting of a combination of picklist values selected by the user.
The page takes too long to display results for some of the input combinations, while for other input choices it throws the exception, "Maximum view state size limit exceeded".
What step should the developer take to resolve this issue?
A. Adjust any code that filters by picklist values since they are not indexed,
B. Remove instances of the transient keyword from the Apex controller to avoid the view state error.
C. Use a StandardSetController or SOQL LIMIT in the Apex controller to limit the number of records displayed at a time.
D. Split the layout to filter records in one Visualforce page and display the list of records in a second page using the same Apex controller.
**
C. Use a StandardSetController or SOQL LIMIT in the Apex controller to limit the number of records displayed at a time. ✅ 
**
Explanation:
To resolve the issue of the Visualforce page taking too long to display results or exceeding the view state limit, the developer should use a StandardSetController or implement SOQL LIMIT in the Apex controller.
This limits the number of records that are processed and displayed at one time, which can prevent view state errors and improve performance.

An org has an existing process, built using Process Builder, on Opportunity that sets a custom field, CommissionBaseAmount__c, when an Opportunity is edited and the Opportunity's Amount changes.
A developer recently deployed an Opportunity before update trigger that uses the CommissionBaseAmount__c and complex logic to calculate a value for a custom field, CommissionAmount__c, when an Opportunity stage changes to Closed/Won.
Users report that when they change the Opportunity to Closed/Won and also change the Amount during the same save, the CommissionAmount__c is incorrect.
Which action should the developer take to correct this problem?
A. A Replace the process with a Fast Field Update record-trigger flow.
B. Call the trigger from the process.
C. Call the process from the trigger.
**
A. A Replace the process with a Fast Field Update record-trigger flow. ✅
**
Explanation:
The issue described is likely due to the order of execution in Salesforce, where processes in Process Builder run after all before triggers. If the Opportunity's Amount is changed and the CommissionBaseAmount__c is set by Process Builder, the trigger that calculates CommissionAmount__c may not see the updated value if it operates before the process.
Replacing the process with a before-save record-triggered flow (formerly known as Fast Field Update) would ensure that CommissionBaseAmount__c is updated before the trigger runs. In a before-save flow, field updates occur before any Apex before update triggers fire, which means the trigger would have the updated value of CommissionBaseAmount__c to use in its calculation.

**
C. Change the CallousUtill .makeRestCallout to an @future method. ✅

Given the code above, which two changes need to be made in the Apex Controller for the code to work?
Choose 2 answers
A. Annotate the entire class as @AuraEnabled instead of just the single method.
B. Change the argument in the Apex Controller line 05 from subject to string.
C. Change the method signature to be global static, not public to String.
D. Remove line 06 from the Apex Controller and instead use firstName in the return on line 07.
**
B. Change the argument in the Apex Controller line 05 from subject to string. ✅
D. Remove line 06 from the Apex Controller and instead use firstName in the return on line 07. ✅
**
Explanation:
Based on the code provided, here are the necessary changes:
* Change B is required because the argument in the Apex controller's serverEcho method must match the data type expected by the JavaScript calling the method. The Apex method expects an Object named firstName, which is then cast to a String inside the method. The JavaScript is passing an object with a property firstName, so no change is needed in the JavaScript.
* Change D is correct because line 06 is redundant and unnecessary. We can directly use firstName in the return statement as it is already a String type. The get() method is typically used when you have a Map and you need to retrieve a value by its key. Since firstName is already being passed as a String, there's no need to cast it or retrieve it using get().

A developer gets an error saying 'Maximum Trigger Depth Exceeded.'
What is a possible reason to get this error message?
A. A trigger is recursively invoked more than 16 times.
B. The SOQL governor limits are being hit.
C. There are numerous DML operations in the trigger logic.
D. A flow trigger was included too many times.
**
A. A trigger is recursively invoked more than 16 times. ✅
**
Explanation:
The "Maximum Trigger Depth Exceeded" error message is typically caused by a trigger being recursively invoked too many times. Salesforce has a limit on the depth of trigger recursion to prevent infinite loops, which is 16 times.

A developer notices the execution of all the test methods in a class takes a long time to run, due to the initial setup of all the test data that is needed to perform the tests. What should the developer do to speed up test execution?
A. Define a method that creates test data and annotate with @testSetup.
B. Define a method that creates test data and annotate with @createData.
C. Ensure proper usage of test data factory in all test methods.
D. Reduce the amount of test methods in the class.
**
A. Define a method that creates test data and annotate with @testSetup. ✅
**
Explanation:
Using the @testSetup annotation to define a method that creates test data before the tests run can significantly speed up test execution by reducing the setup time for each test method in the class. This method runs once before any test method in the class and can be used by all test methods.

Refer to the Aura component below:
<aura:component>
    <aura:attribute name="contactInfo" type="Object"/>
    <aura:attribute name="showContactInfo" type="Boolean" default="true"/>
    <aura:handler name="init" value="{!this}" action="{!c.init}"/>

    <!--- ... other code .... --->
    <aura:if isTrue="{!v.showContactInfo}">
        <c:contactInfo value="{!v.contactInfo}"/>
    </aura:if>
</aura:component>

Controller JS:
({
    init: function(cmp, helper) {
        // ...other code ...
        var show = helper.getShowContactInfo();
        cmp.set("v.showContactInfo", show);
    },

    // other code...
})

A developer receives complaints that the component loads slowly.
Which change can the developer implement to make the component perform faster?
A. Change the type of contactInfo to "Map".
B. Move the contents of <c: contactInfo into the componant.
C. Add a change event handler for showContactInfo.
D. Change the default for showContactInfo to "False.
**
D. Change the default for showContactInfo to "False. ✅
**
Explanation:
To improve the performance of an Aura component that is loading slowly, the developer can make the following change:
* D. Change the default for showContactInfo to "False": By setting the default value of showContactInfo to False, the component does not fetch or render the contact information by default, which can reduce the initial load time. The information can be fetched and displayed later based on user action or other triggers.
Changing the type of contactInfo to "Map" (Option A) or moving the contents of <c:contactInfo> into the component (Option B) may not necessarily improve load times. Adding a change event handler for showContactInfo (Option C) adds more processing and can potentially slow down the component if not handled efficiently.

    accountList.add( anAccount );
}

update accountList;
Consider the above trigger intended to assign the Account to the manager of the Account's region, Which two changes should a developer make in this trigger to adhere to best practices?
A. Use a Map to cache the results of the Region._c query by Id.
B. Move the Region__c query to outside the loop.
C. Use a Map accountMap instead of List accountList.
D. Remove the last line updating accountList as It Is not needed.
**
B. Move the Region__c query to outside the loop. ✅
D. Remove the last line updating accountList as It Is not needed. ✅
**
Explanation:
Moving the SOQL query outside the loop prevents it from being executed multiple times, which can lead to hitting governor limits. The last line updating the accountList is indeed needed to save the changes made to the Account records, so removing it is not recommended. Instead, the query should be moved outside the loop and records should be collected in a map for efficiency, which is not one of the provided options. References:

A developer wrote a class named asccuntRisteryManager that relies on field history tracking. The class has a static method called getaccountHistory that Lakes in an Account as a parameter and returns a list of associated accountHistory object records.
The following test fails:
@isTest
public static void testAccountHistory() {
    Account a = new Account(name = 'test');
    insert a;

    a.name = a.name + '1';
    update a;

    List<AccountHistory> ahList = AccountHistoryManager.getAccountHistory(a);
    System.assert(ahList.size() > 0);
}


What should be done to make this test pass?
A. Create Accountdistory records manually in the test setup and write a query to get them.
B. Use @isTest (SeeAllData=true] to see historical data from the org and query for Accountdistory records.
C. Use Test. isRunningTest (] in getAccountHistory() to conditionally return fake AccountHistory records.
D. The tact method should he delated since this code cannat be tested
**
C. Use Test. isRunningTest (] in getAccountHistory() to conditionally return fake AccountHistory records.  ✅
**
Explanation:
To make the test pass, @isTest(SeeAllData=true) should be used to allow the test to access historical data from the org. This is required because field history tracking data is not copied to a test context, so you need to allow the test to access live data to assert against it.

Consider the following code snippet:
public class searchFeature {
    public static List<List<sObject>> searchRecords(String searchquery) {
        return [FIND :searchquery IN ALL FIELDS RETURNING Account, Opportunity, Lead];
    }
}

A developer created the following test class to provide the proper code coverage for the snippet above:
@isTest
private class searchFeature_Test {

    @TestSetup
    private static void makeData() {
        // insert opportunities, accounts and lead
    }

    @isTest
    private static void searchRecords_Test() {
        List<List<sObject>> records = searchFeature.searchRecords('Test');
        System.assertNotEquals(records.size(), 0);
    }
}


However, when the test runs, no data is returned and the assertion fails.
Which edit should the developer make to ensure the test class runs successfully?
A. Implement the without sharing keyword in the searchFeaturs Apex class.
B. Implement the seeAllData=true attribute in the @1sTest annotation.
C. Enclose the method call within Test. startbest i) and @Test_stopTast |).
D. Implement the setFixedSearchResult= method in the test class.
**
D. Implement the setFixedSearchResult= method in the test class. ✅
**
Explanation:
To ensure that the test class for a search functionality in Salesforce runs successfully, the developer should use the Test.setFixedSearchResults() method. This allows the test to specify the records that are returned by the search, ensuring that the search behavior is predictable and that the assertion can be properly evaluated.

A developer wrote a test class that successfully asserts a trigger on Account, It fires and updates data correctly In a sandbox environment.
A Salesforce admin with a custom profile attempts to deploy this trigger via a change set into the production environment, but the test class falls with an Insufficient privileges error.
What should a developer do to fix the problem?
A. Configure the production environment to enable
"Run All Tests as Admin User."
B. Add System.runAs() to the test class to execute the trigger as a user with the correct object permissions.
C. Add seeallData=true to the test class to work within the sharing model for the production environment.
D. Verify that Test. startTest() Is not Inside a For loop in the test class,
**
B. Add System.runAs() to the test class to execute the trigger as a user with the correct object permissions. ✅
**
Explanation:
When a test class fails with an "Insufficient privileges" error during deployment, it indicates that the user profile under which the tests are being executed doesn't have the necessary permissions to perform the actions required by the test. In a sandbox, the test might have been running with a different set of permissions compared to the production environment.
By using System.runAs(), you can specify a user context in which the test should run, which allows you to simulate the appropriate permissions. For this to work, you need to create a User instance in your test class with the profile that has the necessary permissions and then enclose the logic of your test within a System.
runAs() block with this user.
This is a preferred solution over seeAllData=true, which would give the test access to all data in the production environment, potentially leading to tests that are not isolated and thus less reliable. It's also preferred over changing organization-wide settings or relying on specific setup in test classes, such as making sure Test.startTest() is not inside a loop.

An org has a requirement that an Account must always have one and only one Contact listed as Primary. So selecting one Contact will de-select any others. The client wants a checkbox on the Contact called 'Is Primary' to control this feature.
The client also wants to ensure that the last name of every Contact is stored entirely in uppercase characters.
What is the optimal way to implement these requirements?
A. Write a Validation Rule on the Contact for the Is Primary logic and a before update trigger on Contact for the last name logic.
B. Write an after update trigger on Contact for the Is Primary logic and a separate before update trigger on Contact for the last name logic.
C. Write a single trigger on Contact for both after update and before update and callout to helper classes to handle each set of logic.
D. Write an after update trigger on Account for the Is Primary logic and a before update trigger on Contact for the last name logic.
**
C. Write a single trigger on Contact for both after update and before update and callout to helper classes to handle each set of logic. ✅
**
Explanation:
A single trigger on Contact that handles both after update and before update events, utilizing helper classes for each logic set, is the most optimal implementation. It centralizes the logic for maintaining primary contacts and normalizing last names while allowing for clear separation of concerns through helper classes.

A business requires that every parent record must have a child record. A developer writes an Apex method with two DML statements to insert a parent record and a child record.
A validation rule blocks child records from being created. The method uses a try/catch block to handle the DML exception.
What should the developer do to ensure the parent always has a child record?
A. Use Catabase.inserc() and set the all = parameter to true,
B. Delete the parent record in the catch statement when an error occurs on the child record DML operation.
C. Set a database savepoint to rollback if there are errors.
D. Use addExror() on the parent record if an error occurs on the child record.
**
C. Set a database savepoint to rollback if there are errors. ✅
**
Explanation:
* By setting a savepoint before the DML operations and rolling back to that savepoint in the event of an exception, the developer can ensure that the parent record is not committed without a corresponding child record.

A. PushTopic event
B. Qutbound message
C. Trigger with HTTP callout
D. Platform event

In an organization that has multi-currency enabled, a developer Is tasked with building a Lighting component that displays the top ten Opportunities most recently accessed by the logged in user. The developer must ensure the Amount and LastModifiedDate field values are displayed according to the user's locale.
What is the most effective approach to ensure values displayed respect the user's locale settings?
A. Use REGEX expressions to format the values retrieved via SOQL.
B. Use a wrapper class to format the values retrieved via SOQL.
C. Use the FOR VIEW clause in the SOQL query.
D. Use the FORMAT () function in the SOQL query.
**
D. Use the FORMAT () function in the SOQL query. ✅
**
Explanation:
In a multi-currency Salesforce organization, displaying currency amounts according to the user's locale is crucial for ensuring data clarity and relevance. To achieve this, developers can leverage Salesforce's built-in capabilities to format field values directly within SOQL queries. The FORMAT() function is particularly useful as it formats currency fields according to the organization's locale settings. By using this function in a SOQL query, developers can ensure that the Amount and LastModifiedDate fields are displayed correctly.
This method is more effective and efficient than post-processing the values in Apex, which would be required if using wrapper classes or REGEX expressions. Additionally, using the FOR VIEW clause in a SOQL query will mark records as recently viewed, which does not format the fields as per the user's locale.

A developer created and tested a Visualforce page in their developer sandbox, but now receives reports that user encounter view state errors when using it in production.
What should the developer ensure to correct these errors?
A. Ensure queries do net exceed governor limits,
B. Ensure properties are marked as private,
C. Ensure variables are marked as transient.
D. Ensure profiles have access to the Visualforce page.
**
C. Ensure variables are marked as transient. ✅
**
Explanation:
The view state in Visualforce represents the state of the page - including the components, field values, and controller state. This error usually occurs when the page's view state becomes too large. To resolve this issue:
* C. Ensure variables are marked as transient: The transient keyword in Apex can be used to declare instance variables that should not be part of the view state and therefore not be saved. This is especially useful for large data that does not need to be maintained across postbacks.
Marking properties as private (Option B) or ensuring queries do not exceed governor limits (Option A) might be best practices, but they do not directly impact the view state size. Ensuring profiles have access to the Visualforce page (Option D) is a matter of visibility and access, not related to view state errors.

D. Implement the logic in the custom Visualforce page controller and call "that method from an Apex trigger on Contact.
**
B. Implement the logic in a helper class that is called by an Apex trigger on Contact and from the custom Visualforce page controller. ✅
**
Explanation:
The optimal way to enforce the exclusion of blocked domains for email addresses entered into Contacts and a custom object is to use a helper class. The class can be called by an Apex trigger on the Contact object and from the controller of the custom Visualforce page used for the Survey Response. This centralizes the logic for maintainability and reusability.

05         return [Select Id, Name, Industry FROM Account];
06     }
07 
08 }
As part of the deployment cycle, a developer creates the following test class:

02 
03     @TestSetup
04     private static void makeData(){
05         User user1 = [Select Id FROM User WHERE Profile.Name = 'System Administrator' and isActive = true LIMIT 1];

16         System.assertEquals(20, result.size());
17
18     }
19 
20 }

When the test class runs, the assertion fails.
Which change should the developer implement in the Apex test method to ensure the test method executes successfully?

A.
Add Test.startTest(); to line 12 and enclose lines 15 and 16 within Test.startTest(); and Test.stopTest();.

B.
Add System.runAs(user); to line 14 and enclose line 15 within Test.startTest(); and Test.stopTest();.

C.
Query the Administrator user into memory and enclose lines 15 and 16 within the System.runAs(user); method.

D.
Query the the Standard User into memory and enclose lines 15 and 16 within the System.runAs(user); method.
**
D.
Query the the Standard User into memory and enclose lines 15 and 16 within the System.runAs(user); method. ✅
**
Explanation:
To ensure that test methods execute successfully and are able to verify the behavior of the code, it is important to set up the proper context and to make sure that the test covers the expected outcomes accurately.
* Option B is correct because enclosing the method call within Test.startTest() and Test.stopTest() ensures that any asynchronous operations are completed before the assertions are made. This is crucial when the code being tested is expected to perform operations that may run after the initial transaction, such as future methods, queueable jobs, or batch operations.
* Options A, C, and D are incorrect because they do not address the issue of ensuring that all operations are completed before the assertion is made. Option A incorrectly suggests modifying the test setup code, while Options C and D suggest changes that are not related to the test execution flow.

A developer wrote a trigger on Opportunity that will update a custom Last Sold Date field on the Opportunity's Account whenever an Opportunity is closed. In the test class for the trigger, the assertion to validate the Last Sold Date field fails.
What might be causing the failed assertion?
A. The test class has not defined an Account owner when inserting the test data.
B. The test class has not implemented seealldata=true in the test method.
C. The test class has not re-queried the Account record after updating the Opportunity.
D. The test class is not using System. runs () to run tests as a Salesforce administrator.
**
C. The test class has not re-queried the Account record after updating the Opportunity. ✅
**
Explanation:
The test class may not be re-querying the Account record after updating the Opportunity, which is necessary to verify the updated field values. If the test does not query the database to get the most recent data after the trigger runs, it will not see the changes made by the trigger.

Consider the following code snippet:
public static List<Account> getAccounts(Date thisDate, Id goldenRT) {
    List<Account> accountList = [SELECT Id, Name, Industry FROM Account WHERE CreatedDate = :thisDate OR RecordTypeId = :goldenRT];
    return accountList;
}

The Apex method is executed in an environment with a large data volume count for Accounts, and the query is performing poorly.
Which technique should the developer implement to ensure the query performs optimally, while preserving the entire result set?
A. Create a formula field to combine the createdDate and RecordType value, then filter based on the formula.
B. Break down the query into two individual queries and join the two result sets.
C. Annotate the method with the @Future annotation
D. Use the Database queryLocator method to retrieve the accounts.
**
B. Break down the query into two individual queries and join the two result sets. ✅
**
Explanation:
When dealing with large data volumes in Salesforce and ensuring optimal performance for queries, it's important to choose an approach that both handles the data volume efficiently and retrieves the complete result set.
* Option D is correct because using the Database.QueryLocator method is a best practice for handling large data volumes. It is typically used with batch Apex, which can process records in batches, thus reducing the likelihood of hitting governor limits. It's designed to handle very large data sets that would otherwise exceed normal SOQL query limits.
* Option A is incorrect because creating a formula field doesn't improve the performance of the query. It simply creates a new field that combines existing data, but it does not inherently optimize the query execution.
* Option B is incorrect because breaking down the query into two parts and joining them in Apex could potentially be less efficient and would require additional code to manage the combined result sets. This approach does not leverage the built-in Salesforce features designed to handle large data volumes.
* Option C is incorrect because the @Future annotation makes the method execute asynchronously, but it does not help with query performance or large data volume management.

A company has a web page that needs to get Account record information, such as name, website, and employee number. The Salesforce record 1D is known to the web page and it uses JavaScript to retrieve the account information.
Which method of integration is optimal?
A. Apex SOAP web service
B. SOAP API
C. Apex REST web service
D. REST API
**
D. REST API ✅
**
Explanation:
For retrieving specific records using a known ID, the REST API is optimal due to its stateless, cacheable communications and lightweight structure. It's ideal for web applications that use JavaScript to make requests directly from the user's browser. Using the REST API, the web page can make a simple HTTP GET request to the Salesforce REST service endpoint and retrieve the account information in a format that's easily handled by JavaScript (typically JSON).

A developer is building a Lightning web component that searches
for Contacts. The component must communicate the search
results to other unrelated Lightning web components, that are in
different DOM trees, when the search completes.
What should the developer do to implement the communication?
A. Fire an application event.
B. Publish an event on an event channel.
C. Fire a custom component event.
D. Publish a message on a message channel.
**
D. Publish a message on a message channel. ✅
**
Explanation:
For communication between unrelated Lightning web components that are in different DOM trees, the most suitable approach is to use the Lightning Message Service (LMS). This service allows components to communicate with each other using a message channel, which is particularly useful when the components are not in the same containment hierarchy. By publishing and subscribing to messages on a message channel, components can exchange data and notifications, which is ideal for the scenario described.

Apex controller class (AccountContactsController.cls):
public with sharing class AccountContactsController {
    @AuraEnabled
    public static List<Contact> getAccountContacts(String accountId) {
        return [SELECT Id, Name, Email, Phone FROM Contact WHERE AccountId = :accountId];
    }
}
Based on the code snippets, what change should be made to display the contacts' mailing addresses in the Lightning web component?
A. Add a new method in the Apex controller class to retneve the mailing addresses separately and modify the Lightning web component to invoke this method.
B. Extend the lightning-datatable component in the Lightning web component to include a column for the MailingAddress field.
C. Modify the SOQL guery in the getAccountContacts method to include the MailingAddress field.
D. Modify the SOQL query in the getAccountContacts method to include the MailingAddress field and update the columns attribute in javascript file to add Mailing address fields.
**
D. Modify the SOQL query in the getAccountContacts method to include the MailingAddress field and update the columns attribute in javascript file to add Mailing address fields.✅
**
Explanation:
To display the contacts' mailing addresses in the Lightning web component, both the SOQL query in the getAccountContacts method and the columns attribute in the JavaScript file of the component need to be updated. The query must include the MailingAddress field, and the JavaScript file must be modified to add this field to the columns shown in the lightning-datatable.

C. Add a teardown block to reset the DOM after each test.
D. Create a new jsdom instance for each test.
**
B. Reset the DOM after each test with the after Each() method. ✅

Universal Containers needs to integrate with their own, existing, internal custom web application. The web application accepts JSON payloads, resizes product images, and sends the resized images back to Salesforce.
What should the developer use to implement this integration?
A. An Apex trigger that calls an @future method that allows callouts
B. A platform event that makes a callout to the web application
C. A flow that calls an @future method that allows callouts
D. A flow with an outbound message that contains a session ID
**
A. An Apex trigger that calls an @future method that allows callouts ✅
**
Explanation:
In a scenario where an integration requires making a callout to an external web application, Apex is often used to perform callouts. The callout must be asynchronous when being made from a trigger because a callout cannot be made from a synchronous operation like a trigger due to the possibility of long-running transactions.
* Option A (An Apex trigger that calls an @future method that allows callouts) is correct because it enables the trigger to perform an asynchronous callout to the external web application, which is necessary for sending JSON payloads and receiving the resized images.
* Options B, C, and D do not fit the requirement as well as option A because platform events and flows are typically not used for making direct callouts to external systems in the context described.

Refer to the code snippet below:
public static void updateCreditMemo(String customerId, Decimal newAmount) {
    List<Credit_Memo__c> toUpdate = new List<Credit_Memo__c>();
    for (Credit_Memo__c creditMemo : [SELECT Id, Name, Amount__c FROM Credit_Memo__c WHERE Customer_Id__c = :customerId LIMIT 50]) {
        creditMemo.Amount__c = newAmount;
        toUpdate.add(creditMemo);
    }
    Database.update(toUpdate, false);
}


A custom object called Credit_Memo__c exists in a Salesforce environment. As part of a new feature development that retrieves and manipulates this type of record, the developer needs to ensure race conditions are prevented when a set of records are modified within an Apex transaction.
In the preceding Apex code, how can the developer alter the query statement to use SOQL features to prevent race conditions within a transaction?
A.
[SELECT Id, Name, Amount__c FROM Credit_Memo__c WHERE Customer_Id__c = :customerId LIMIT 50 FOR UPDATE] ✅
B.
[SELECT Id, Name, Amount__c FROM Credit_Memo__c WHERE Customer_Id__c = :customerId LIMIT 50 FOR VIEW]
C.
[SELECT Id, Name, Amount__c FROM Credit_Memo__c WHERE Customer_Id__c = :customerId USING SCOPE LIMIT 50]
D
[SELECT Id, Name, Amount__c FROM Credit_Memo__c WHERE Customer_Id__c = :customerId LIMIT 50 FOR REFERENCE]
**
A.
[SELECT Id, Name, Amount__c FROM Credit_Memo__c WHERE Customer_Id__c = :customerId LIMIT 50 FOR UPDATE]
**
Explanation:
To prevent race conditions during an Apex transaction, the SOQL query can be modified to include the "FOR UPDATE" keyword. This keyword locks the records that are returned by the query, preventing other transactions from modifying them until the current transaction is complete. This ensures that the retrieved records cannot be changed by another process before the current transaction is completed, thus preventing race conditions. The correct option to use in the code snippet provided is:
[SELECT Id, Name, Amount__c FROM Credit_Memo__c WHERE Customer_Id__c = :customerId LIMIT
50 FOR UPDATE]
This will lock up to 50 records of Credit_Memo__c with the specified Customer_Id__c for the duration of the transaction.

A developer is inserting, updating, and deleting multiple lists of records in a single transaction and wants to ensure that any error prevents all execution.
How should the developer implement error exception handling in their code to handle this?
A. Use Database methods to obtain lists of Database.SaveResults.
B. Use a try-catch statement and handle DML cleanup in the catch statement,
C. Use Database.setSavepoint {} and Database.rollBack with a try-catch statement.
D. Use a try-catch and use sObject.addError() on any failures.
**
C. Use Database.setSavepoint {} and Database.rollBack with a try-catch statement. ✅
**
Explanation:
Using Database.setSavepoint() and Database.rollback() within a try-catch statement is the recommended approach for handling transactions that involve multiple DML operations. This allows the developer to roll back all changes if an error occurs, ensuring that partial changes are not committed to the database.

B. Use the Database method with a110rNone Set to false.
C. Add the <apex:messages/> tag to the component.
D. Add JavaScript and HTML to display an error message.
**
D. Add JavaScript and HTML to display an error message. ✅

Which code snippet processes records in the most memory efficient manner, avoiding governor limits such as
"Apex heap size too large"?
A.
List<Opportunity> opportunities = [SELECT Id, Amount FROM Opportunity];
for (Opportunity opp : opportunities) {
    // perform operation here
}
B.
for (Opportunity opp : [SELECT Id, Amount FROM Opportunity]) {
    // perform operation here
}
C.
Map<Id, Opportunity> opportunities = new Map<Id, Opportunity>([SELECT Id, Amount FROM Opportunity]);
for (Id oppId : opportunities.keySet()) {
    // perform operation here
}
D.
List<Opportunity> opportunities = Database.query('SELECT Id, Amount FROM Opportunity');
for (Opportunity opp : opportunities) {
    // perform operation here
}
**
B.  ✅
for (Opportunity opp : [SELECT Id, Amount FROM Opportunity]) {
    // perform operation here

Explanation:
Option D, which uses the Database.query() method in combination with a for loop, is the most memory- efficient way to process records. This is known as the Query Locator pattern, which allows you to work with a large number of records by querying them in batches. This approach helps to avoid hitting the governor limit for "Apex heap size too large" as it processes one record at a time from the database without storing the entire result set in memory.

B. SELECT FIELDS (ALL) FROM Account WHERE Name = 'Acme' LIMIT 1  ✅
**
Explanation:
The correct SOQL query to retrieve all fields for a specific Account is to use the FIELDS(ALL) function within the SELECT clause of the SOQL query. This will return all fields for the Account named 'Acme'.

Which three approaches should a developer implement to obtain the best performance for data retrieval when building a Lightning web component? Choose 3 answers
A. Use lazy load for occasionally accessed data.
B. Use layoutTypes: 9'Full') to display a set of fields.
C. Use the Lightning Data Service.
D. Use getRecordUi to obtain metadata.
E. Use {Cacheable=true} whenever possible
**
A. Use lazy load for occasionally accessed data. ✅
C. Use the Lightning Data Service. ✅
E. Use {Cacheable=true} whenever possible ✅
**
Explanation:
* Lazy loading improves performance by loading data only when needed.
* Lightning Data Service (LDS) handles data operations and caching efficiently.
* Using {Cacheable=true} on Apex methods enables the Lightning Component framework to cache the method's return value, reducing server round-trips for the same data.

A company accepts orders for customers in their enterprise resource planning (ERP) system that must be integrated into Salesforce as order_ c records with a lookup field to Account. The Account object has an external ID field, ENF_Customer_ID_c.
What should the Integration use to create new Oder_c records that will automatically be related to the correct Account?
A. Upsert on the Order__c object and specify the ERP_Customer_ID__c for the Account relationship.
B. Insert on the Order__c object followed by an update on the Order__c object.
C. Merge on the Order__c object and specify the ERP_Customer_ID__c for the Account relationship.
D. Upsert on the Account and specify the ERP_Customer_ID__c for the relationship.
**
A. Upsert on the Order__c object and specify the ERP_Customer_ID__c for the Account relationship. ✅
**
Explanation:
When integrating external systems with Salesforce and creating records that need to be associated with existing Salesforce records based on an external ID, Salesforce provides the ability to reference an external ID field in a related object directly within a create or update call.
* Option A is correct because the upsert operation can be used to either insert new records or update existing ones. By specifying the external ID field (ENF_Customer_ID__c) for the Account relationship, the system will automatically link the Order__c record to the correct Account based on the external ID provided by the ERP system.
* Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they do not specifically utilize the capability of referencing an external ID to associate records during an integration process.

Business rules require a Contact ta always be created when a new Account is created.
What can be used when developing a custom screen to ensure an Account is not created if the creation of the Contact fails?
A. Use setSaverpoint (1) and rollback() with a try-catch block.
B. Use the Database. Insect method with a11orNone SEL LO alee,
C. Use the Database. Delete method if the Contact insertion fails.
D. Disable validation rules on Contacts and set default values with a trigger.
**
A. Use setSaverpoint (1) and rollback() with a try-catch block. ✅
**
Explanation:
When developing a custom screen that requires both an Account and Contact to be created together, using setSavepoint() and rollback() within a try-catch block is a reliable way to ensure that if the Contact creation fails, the Account creation is also rolled back, maintaining data integrity.

A developer created a Lightning web component for the Account record page that displays the five most recently contacted Contacts for an Account. The Apex method, Contacts, returns a list of Contacts and will be wired to a property in the component.
01:
02: public class ContactFetcher {
03:
04:     static List<Contact> getRecentContacts(Id accountId) {

10:         //...implementation...
11:     }
12: }

Which two lines must change in the above code to make the Apex method able to be wired?
Choose 2 answers
A. Add @AuraEnabled {cacheable=trues) to line 08.
B. Remove private from line 09.
C. Add public to line 04.
D. Add @AuraEnabled {cacheable=true) to line 03.
**
C. Add public to line 04. ✅
D. Add @AuraEnabled {cacheable=true) to line 03. ✅
**
Explanation:
To make an Apex method callable from a Lightning Web Component, you need to annotate the method with
@AuraEnabled and mark it as cacheable if it's only retrieving data without modifying it. Additionally, the method must be public to be accessible from the component.
* Line 04: Needs @AuraEnabled(cacheable=true) to allow the method to be called from the Lightning Web Component and indicate that the method doesn't modify any data, making it suitable for caching.
* Line 09: The method getFiveMostRecent should not be private because private methods cannot be called from a Lightning Web Component. Changing it to public (or default, which is equivalent to public within the same namespace) is required.

A developer has a Visualforce page that automatically assigns ewnership of an Account to a queue upon save.
The page appears to correctly assign ownership, but an assertion validating the correct ownership fails.
What can cause this problem?
A. The test class does not retrieve the updated value from the database,
B. The test class does not use the Bulk API for loading test data.
C. The test class does not use the seeallData=true= annotation.
D. The test class does not implement the Queueable interface.
**
A. The test class does not retrieve the updated value from the database, ✅
**
Explanation:
If the test class does not retrieve the updated value from the database, it will not see any changes made by the page logic. This can cause assertions that check for those changes to fail. The test should query for the most recent value from the database after the operation that is supposed to update the value.

A company wants to run different logic based on an Opportunity's record type.
Which code segment handles this request and follows best practices?

A
RecordType recType_New = [SELECT Id, Name FROM RecordType WHERE SObjectType = 'Opportunity' AND IsActive = True AND DeveloperName = 'New' LIMIT 1];

RecordType recType_Renewal = [SELECT Id, Name FROM RecordType WHERE SObjectType = 'Opportunity' AND IsActive = True AND DeveloperName = 'Renewal' LIMIT 1];

for(Opportunity o : Trigger.new) {

B
List<RecordType> recTypes = [SELECT Id, Name FROM RecordType WHERE SObjectType = 'Opportunity' AND
C
Id recType_New =  
Schema.SObjectType.Opportunity.getRecordTypeInfosByDeveloperName().get('New').getRecordTypeId();

    }  
}
**
C  ✅
Id recType_New =  
Schema.SObjectType.Opportunity.getRecordTypeInfosByDeveloperName().get('New').getRecordTypeId();

Id recType_Renewal =  
Schema.SObjectType.Opportunity.getRecordTypeInfosByDeveloperName().get('Renewal').getRecordTypeId();

    }  
    else if (o.RecordTypeId == recType_Renewal) {  
        // do some logic for Record Type 2  
    }  
}
**
Explanation:
The use of getRecordTypeInfosByDeveloperName is a best practice to handle record types. This approach avoids the need for SOQL queries, reducing the number of governor limits consumed, and efficiently retrieves record type Ids by their DeveloperName, which is consistent across all Salesforce environments.

A developer created 2 class that implements the Queueable Interface, as follows:
public class without sharing OrderQueueableJob implements Queueable {
    public void execute(QueueableContext context) {
        // implementation logic
        System.enqueueJob(new FollowupJob());
    }
}
As part of the deployment process, the developer is asked to create a corresponding test class.
Which two actions should the developer take to successfully execute the test class?
Choose 2 answers
A. Implement seeAllData=True to ensure the Queueable job is able to run in bulk mode.
B. Ensure the running user of the test class has, at I the View All permission on the Order object.
C. Enclose System.enqueueJob(new OrderQueueableJob ()] within Tess. and Test .stopTest (1.
D. Implement Test. isRunningTest() to prevent chaining jobs during test execution.
**
C. Enclose System.enqueueJob(new OrderQueueableJob ()] within Tess. and Test .stopTest (1. ✅
D. Implement Test. isRunningTest() to prevent chaining jobs during test execution. ✅
**
Explanation:
When writing a test class for a Queueable class in Salesforce, the goal is to ensure that the asynchronous code is executed within the test context and that it does not affect the state of the production org or depend on its data.
* Option C is correct because using Test.startTest() and Test.stopTest() ensures that the asynchronous code is executed immediately within the test's context. This is essential for testing Queueable classes because it allows the test to wait for the asynchronous process to complete before assertions are made.
Without this, the asynchronous job would not necessarily run during the test execution.
* Option D is correct because Test.isRunningTest() can be used within the Queueable class to prevent the chaining of jobs during test execution. Chaining queueable jobs can lead to governor limits being hit and is generally not allowed in test methods. This conditional check allows the developer to bypass sections of the code not suitable for a testing context.
* Option A is incorrect because the seeAllData=True annotation is not required for testing Queueable classes, and it is not a best practice to depend on live data for tests. It's preferable to create test data within the test class itself.
* Option B is incorrect because having the 'View All' permission on the Order object is not related to the successful execution of the Queueable class in tests. Permissions are typically not enforced in test contexts unless using System.runAs() to test with a specific user context.

Universal Containers uses Big Objects to store almost a billion customer transactions called Customer_Transaction__b.
These are the fields on Customer_Transaction__b:
Account__c -
Program__c -
Points_Earned__c -
Location__c -
Transaction_Date__c -
The following fields have been identified as Index Fields for the Customer_Transaction__b object:
Account__c, Program__c, and Transaction_Date__c.
Which SOQL query is valid on the Customer_Transaction__b Big Object?
A. SELECT Account__c, Program__c, Transaction_Date__c FROM Customer_Transaction__b WHERE Account__c = '001R000000302D3' AND Program__c ='Shoppers' AND Transaction_Date__c=2019-05-31T00:00Z
B. SELECT Account__c, Program__c, Transaction_Date__c FROM Customer_Transaction__b WHERE Account__c = '001R000000302D3' AND Program__c LIKE 'Shop%' AND Transaction_Date__c=2019-05-31T00:00Z
C. SELECT Account__c, Program__c, Transaction_Date__c FROM Customer_Transaction__b WHERE Account__c = '001R000000302D3' AND Program__c INCLUDES ('Shoppers', 'Womens') AND Transaction_Date__c=2019-05-31T00:00Z
D. SELECT Account__c, Program__c, Transaction_Date__c FROM Customer_Transaction__b WHERE Account__c = '001R000000302D3' AND Program__c EXCLUDES ('Shoppers', 'Womens') AND Transaction_Date__c=2019-05-31T00:00Z

**
Explanation:
The valid SOQL query on a Big Object must match the indexed fields exactly. Since Account__c, Program__c, and Transaction_Date__c are the indexed fields, the SOQL query must specify those fields exactly in the WHERE clause, including exact match conditions (no LIKE or INCLUDES).

        theData.Name = someObj.Name;
        theData.Option = anotherObj.Option__c;
        return theData;
    }
}


The developer verified that the queries return a single record each and there is error handling in the Aura component, but the component is not getting anything back when calling the controller getSemeData.
'What is wrong?
A. Instances of Apex classes, such as MyDatsWrapper, cannot be returned to a Lightning component.
B. The member's Name and option should not have getter and setter.
C. The member's Name and option should not be declared public.
D. The member's Kame and option of the class MyDataWrapper should be annotated with @AuraEnabled also.
**
D. The member's Kame and option of the class MyDataWrapper should be annotated with @AuraEnabled also. ✅
**
Explanation:
For the data to be passed back to the Aura component, all properties of the Apex class that are intended to be accessed from the component need to be annotated with @AuraEnabled. Without this annotation, the Aura framework cannot serialize the properties to send them to the front end.

A developer needs to implement a system audit feature that allows users, assigned to a custom profile named
"Auditors", to perform searches against the historical records in the Account object. The developer must ensure the search is able to return history records that are between 6 and 12 months old.
Given the code below, which select statement should be inserted below as a valid way to retrieve the Account History records ranging from 6 to 12 months old?

Date initialDate = System.Today().addMonths(-12);
Date endDate = System.Today().addMonths(-6);
// Insert SELECT statement here
A. SELECT AccountId, CreatedDate, Field, NewValue, OldValue 
FROM AccountHistory 
WHERE CreatedDate >= :initialDate AND CreatedDate <= :endDate

B. SELECT AccountId, CreatedDate, Field, NewValue, OldValue 
FROM Account__History 
WHERE CreatedDate >= :endDate AND CreatedDate <= :initialDate

C. SELECT AccountId, CreatedDate, Field, NewValue, OldValue 
FROM AccountHistory

D. SELECT AccountId, CreatedDate, Field, NewValue, OldValue 
FROM Account__History 
WHERE CreatedDate >= :initialDate AND CreatedDate <= :endDate
**
A. ✅ SELECT AccountId, CreatedDate, Field, NewValue, OldValue  
FROM AccountHistory 
WHERE CreatedDate >= :initialDate AND CreatedDate <= :endDate
**
Explanation:
Given the code snippet, the correct query to retrieve Account History records between 6 and 12 months old would be the one that includes a WHERE clause filtering records where the CreatedDate is greater than or equal to initialDate and less than or equal to endDate. Option B's statement does this correctly by using the >
= and <= operators to define the range between initialDate (which is set to today's date minus 12 months) and endDate (set to today's date minus 6 months). Options A, C, and D either use incorrect comparison operators or compare against the wrong variables, resulting in an incorrect data set being returned.

As part of a custom interface, a developer team creates various new Lightning web components. Each of the components handles errors using toast messages. When the development is complete, all the components are added to the same Lightning page.
During acceptance testing, users complain about the long chain of toast messages that display when errors occur loading the components.
Which two techniques should the developer implement to improve the user experience?
Choose 2 answers
A. Use a Lightning web component to aggregate and display all errors
B. Use the window.alert() method to display the error messages
C. Use a <tamplate> tag to display in-place error messages.
D. Use public, properties on each component to display the error messages.
**
A. Use a Lightning web component to aggregate and display all errors ✅
C. Use a <tamplate> tag to display in-place error messages. ✅
**
Explanation:
The scenario describes a common issue when multiple components are used on the same Lightning page and each component manages its error handling independently, leading to a "long chain of toast messages" which can be overwhelming for users.
To improve user experience, the developers can implement the following techniques:
A: Use a Lightning web component to aggregate and display all errors: This method involves creating a centralized component responsible for handling all error messages. This component would receive error notifications from other components and then display them in a user-friendly manner. The benefit of this approach is that it provides a single, consistent interface for error messages, reducing the clutter and confusion that can be caused by multiple toasts.
D: Use public properties on each component to display the error messages: By using public properties, components can expose their error states to a parent or orchestrating component, which can then display these errors in a single, consolidated way. This avoids the issue of multiple toast notifications and allows for a more integrated error handling experience.
The other options presented are less ideal:
B: Using the window.alert() method is not recommended in a professional Salesforce environment as it is considered a disruptive way to show errors and does not align with the Salesforce Lightning design system.
C: Using a <template> tag to display in-place error messages could be a viable option for displaying error messages within the component itself, but it does not address the issue of multiple errors stacking up from different components as described in the scenario.

Universal Containers has an Apex trigger on Account that creates an Account Plan record when an Account is marked as a Customer.
Recently a record-triggered flow was added so that whenever an Account is marked as a Customer, a
"Customer Since' date field is updated with today's date. Since the addition of the flow, two Account Plan records are created whenever the Account is marked as a Customer.
What might cause this to happen?
A. The Apex trigger does not use a static variable to ensure it only fires once.
B. The flow is configured to use an "Update Records' element.
C. The Apex trigger is not bulk safe and calls insert inside of a for loop.
D. The flow is configured to evaluate when a record is created and every time it is edited.
**
A. The Apex trigger does not use a static variable to ensure it only fires once. ✅
**
Explanation:
If a flow is configured to evaluate when a record is created and every time it's edited, and an Apex trigger also fires upon the same conditions, it could result in duplicate operations. In this case, two Account Plan records are created because both the flow and the trigger execute upon the Account being marked as a Customer.

Universal Containers wants to notify an external system, in the event that an unhandled exception occurs, by publishing a custom event using Apex.
What is the appropriate publish/subscribe logic to meet this requirement?
A. Publish the error event using the Eventrus.publish() method and have the external system subscribe to the event using CometD.
B. Publish the error event using the addError () method and write a trigger to subscribe to the event and notify the external system.
C. Have the external system subscribe to the event channel. No publishing is necessary.
D. Publish the error event using the addError () method and have the external system subscribe to the event using CometD.
**
A. Publish the error event using the Eventrus.publish() method and have the external system subscribe to the event using CometD. ✅

Which three techniques can a developer use to debug the JavaScript?
Choose 3 answers
A. Use console.log () messages in the JavaScript.
B. Use the browser's dev tools to debug the JavaScript.
C. Enable Debug Mode for Lightning components for the user.
D. Use Developer Console to view checkpoints.
E. Use Developer Console to view the debug log.
**
A. Use console.log () messages in the JavaScript. ✅
B. Use the browser's dev tools to debug the JavaScript. ✅
C. Enable Debug Mode for Lightning components for the user. ✅
**
Explanation:
When debugging JavaScript in a Lightning Component, developers can utilize the following techniques:
* A. Use console.log() messages in the JavaScript: This is a standard debugging technique to log information to the browser console, which can help trace the execution flow or output variable values.
* B. Use the browser's dev tools to debug the JavaScript: Modern browsers come equipped with developer tools that can be used to set breakpoints, step through code, and inspect variables at runtime.
* C. Enable Debug Mode for Lightning components for the user: Enabling Debug Mode for users provides more detailed error messages and unminified versions of client-side libraries, making it easier to debug issues.
Using the Developer Console to view checkpoints (Option D) and debug logs (Option E) is more relevant for Apex debugging rather than JavaScript.

A. Call rafrasnApex() ON this.dazta.
B. Create a new variable to store the result and annotate it with @track.
C. Create a variable to store the result and call refreshpex().
D. Add the @track decorator to the data variable.
**
C. Create a variable to store the result and call refreshpex(). ✅
**
Explanation:
In Lightning Web Components (LWC), the data displayed in a component is not automatically refreshed when a new record is saved to the database. To refresh the displayed list of records in a lightning-datatable after a save operation, developers should use the refreshApex() function. This function is imported from the
@salesforce/apex module and is used to refresh the cache and re-execute the Apex wire method to fetch the latest data from the server. The @track decorator is no longer necessary in most cases due to reactive properties being the default behavior in LWC as of Spring '20 release. Also, calling refreshApex() on this.
data directly or creating a new tracked variable will not initiate a refresh of the cached data.

Explanation:
The best practices for writing triggers in Salesforce include bulkifying your code to handle multiple records efficiently and reducing the number of SOQL queries, especially within loops, to avoid hitting governor limits.
* Option B is correct because moving the SOQL query outside of the for loop is essential to bulkify the trigger. Performing a query within a loop can cause a SOQL governor limit to be reached if the trigger is processing many records. The best practice is to collect all necessary data before the loop starts and then process it within the loop.
* Option C is correct as well, because using a Map to cache the results of a SOQL query by Id is another way to bulkify the code. This allows you to query all the necessary data once and then access it efficiently in memory, avoiding repeated queries.
* Option A is incorrect because adding isExecuting before the update doesn't address any best practices related to bulkification or SOQL query optimization.
* Option D is incorrect because the last line should not be removed if the developer intends to perform DML on the accountList. However, this line should be outside of the loop and is unnecessary if the trigger context is 'before insert' or 'before update', since in those contexts, changes to records in Trigger.
new are implicitly saved without the need for explicit DML.

The Account object has a field, Audit_Code_c, that is used to specify what type of auditing the Account needs and a Lookup to User, zudizar_c, that is the assigned auditor. When an Account is initially created, the user specifies the Audit_Code c. Each User in the org has a unique text field, Audit_Code _e, that is used to automatically assign the correct user to the Account's Auditor_c field.
trigger AccountTrigger on Account (before insert) {
    AuditAssigner.setAuditor(Trigger.new);

What should be changed to most optimize the code's efficiency?
Choose 2 answers
A. Add an initial SOQL query to get all distinct audit codes.
B. Build a Map<string, List<Account>> of audit code to accounts.
C. Build a Map<Id, List<string>>of Account Id to audit codes.
D. Add a WHERE clause to the SOQL query to filter on audit codes.
**
B. Build a Map<string, List<Account>> of audit code to accounts. ✅
D. Add a WHERE clause to the SOQL query to filter on audit codes. ✅
**
Explanation:
To optimize the code's efficiency when assigning users to the Account's Auditor field based on the audit code, the following changes should be considered:
B: Building a map of audit code to accounts (Map<string, List<Account>>) would allow for efficient grouping of accounts by their audit code. This would make it easier to process accounts with the same audit code in a single operation, reducing the number of SOQL queries and DML operations needed.
D: Adding a WHERE clause to the SOQL query to filter on audit codes would limit the number of records returned by the query. This means the code only processes relevant User records with matching audit codes, thereby reducing the processing time and memory consumption.
Option A is not recommended because querying for all distinct audit codes without any context of the accounts being processed could be inefficient. Option C is less effective because it would involve creating a mapping of Account Ids to audit codes, which doesn't aid in the efficient assignment of auditor to accounts.

When the code is executed, the callout is unsuccessful and the following error appears within the Developer Console:
System.CalloutException: Unauthorized endpoint
Which recommended approach should the developer implement
to resolve the callout exception?
A. Annotate the getkRFCatalogContents method with @Future (Callout-true),
B. Change the access modifier for ERPCatalog from public to global.
C. Use the SetHeader() method to specify Basic Authentication,
D. Create a remote site setting configuration that includes the endpoint.
**
D. Create a remote site setting configuration that includes the endpoint. ✅
**
Explanation:
The System.CalloutException with the message "Unauthorized endpoint" typically indicates that the endpoint to which the callout is being made has not been authorized in the Salesforce org's security settings. To resolve this, the developer must navigate to the Remote Site Settings in the Salesforce Setup and add the endpoint URL as a new remote site. This step is necessary to authorize the Salesforce org to send outbound callouts to that specific endpoint. Annotating with @Future(Callout=true) is necessary for making callouts from methods that perform DML operations, but it does not resolve endpoint authorization issues. Similarly, changing the access modifier or using SetHeader() for authentication would not address the unauthorized endpoint error.

A developer sees test failures in the sandbox but not in production. No code or metadata changes have been actively made to either environment since the sandbox was created.
Which consideration should be checked to resolve the issue?
A. Ensure that Disable Parallel Apex Testing Is unchecked.
B. Ensure test classes are using SeeAllData = true.
C. Ensure the sandbox Is on the same release as production.
D. Ensure the Apex classes are on the same API version.
**
C. Ensure the sandbox Is on the same release as production. ✅
**
Explanation:
If test failures are occurring in a sandbox but not in production and there have been no active code or metadata changes, it could be due to differences in the Salesforce release versions between the two environments. Sandboxes can be on preview instances which get upgraded to new releases before production instances. This can lead to differences in behavior and could affect test executions. Ensuring that both the sandbox and production are on the same release can resolve such issues. API version differences and parallel testing settings typically do not cause discrepancies if the code hasn't changed, and while using SeeAllData=true is generally not recommended due to its dependence on the organization's data, it's unlikely to be the cause if the issue is related to the environment rather than the data.

A developer needs to add code to a Lightning web component's configuration file so the component only renders for a desktop size form factor when on a record page.
What should the developer add to the component's record page target configuration to meet this requirement?
A.
<design>
    <designAttribute name="formFactor" value="Large"/>
</design>
B.
<supportedFormFactors>
    <supportedFormFactor type="Large"/>
</supportedFormFactors>
C.
<lightning:layout formFactor="Large">
</lightning:layout>
D.
<property name="formFactor" value="Large">
</property>
**
B. ✅
<supportedFormFactors>
    <supportedFormFactor type="Large"/>
</supportedFormFactors>
**
Explanation:
When you want a Lightning web component to only render for a specific form factor, you can use the <targets
> tag within the component's .xml configuration file. To specify that the component should only appear on a desktop, you use the <targetConfig> tag with the targets="lightning__RecordPage" attribute and nest a < supportedFormFactors> tag inside it. Within this tag, you include a <supportedFormFactor> tag with the attribute type="Large".
Option B is the correct markup to ensure that the component only appears for the desktop form factor on a record page.

Universal Containers (UC) has an ERP system that stores customer Information, When an Account is created in Salesforce, the ERP system's REST endpoint for creating new customers must automatically be called with the Account information. If the call to the ERP system falls, the Account should still be created. Accounts in the UC org are only created, one at a time, by users in the UC customer on-boarding department.
What should a developer implement to make the call to the ERP
system's REST endpoint?
A. REST call from JavaScript
B. Headless Quick Action
C. Call a Queueable from a Trigger
D. Apex Continuation
**
C. Call a Queueable from a Trigger ✅
**
Explanation:
Since the requirement is to make a callout to an external ERP system when an Account is created and still allow for the Account creation even if the call fails, a Queueable class called from a trigger is the best solution. Queueable Apex allows you to submit jobs for asynchronous processing similar to future methods but with additional benefits such as chaining jobs and monitoring the job status.
By using a Queueable, the callout can be made after the Account is created, which respects the Salesforce order of execution and avoids the limitation of callouts not being allowed after DML operations in the same transaction. This approach also does not block the user interface or the creation of the Account record if the callout to the ERP system takes a long time or fails.
